20-Jan-2006

    std::vector in place of Array for storing arrays.
    Using std::string allows us to remove a lot of string copying code.

    message classes where a char* is cast to a const char*. Doing this
    cast can lead to a memory leak.

    using them in a database query.

    creating queries.
