   - Made the stamina be updated per frame basis instead of per keypress.
   - Added recovery and drain rate for the stamina
 - swedishcoder added a comment about the DR function.
 - azaghal implemented classes SectorDataManager, ItemDataManager, and
   DoorDataManager, acting as replacement for current classes, and intended
   to prevent code duplication. Updated the client code to use them.

14-Oct-2007
 - Sueastside changed sit code to send new pose when standing.
 - Sueastside added mounted animation.
 - Sueastside made buddywindow operational again.

12-Oct-2007
 - azaghal added code for jumping client-side and server-side.
 - Sueastside added Induane's tavern interior.

 - azaghal moved Client::ActionHit() to CombatMGR. Moved
   Client::ActionOnInteract() mount-related interaction to
   MountEntity::Interact(). Added yet another playing state to CombatMGR.
   Camera follows the mount now when player is mounted.

10-Oct-2007
 - azaghal moved non-path-finding movement and camera data and actions from
   Client to PlayerEntity. Added support for reinitializing the PlayerEntity
   instance, destroying the old one.
 - azaghal added hackish hopping effect to first-person view (change limitFPS
   in PT::Client constructor to something sane to see it).
 - azaghal added support for different door open/close animations. Added
   support for door opening inwards/outwards, and changed the code and data
   appropriately.
 - azaghal finished implementation of basic client-side support for poses.
 - Sueastside added code to play pose animations.

08-Oct-2007
 - azaghal moved "low-level" object initialization from PtEntityManager to
   appropriate Pt*Entity classes. Rewritten portions of PtEntity and its
   children for a cleaner structure. Added singleton class PtPlayerEntity
   representing the player himself.
 - Sueastside stripped Pt from all entity classes and filenames.
 - azaghal moved several properties from EntityManager to PlayerEntity and
   changed the remaining code appropriately.

07-Oct-2007
 - PK added MeshId to the network messages.
 - PK replaced mesh and name in door entity with doorId.
 - Sueastside added DoorManager to work with doorId.
 - Sueastside tweaked whisper and chatlog layouts.

06-Oct-2007
 - swedishcoder fixed warnings in characterentity.cpp where float was passed to
   function expecting int. Also fixed a missing newline in doorentity.cpp
 - Sueastside made some MSVC fixes for InputManager.
 - azaghal moved PtEntity and related classes to PT::Entity namespace, removed
   doubled EntityType enum from EntityEvent, and made appropriate changes
   throughout to use PT::Entity::PtEntity::EntityType instead.

05-Oct-2007
 - Sueastside changed option saving behaviour to always save to user directory.
 - swedishcoder fixed two "warning: converting to 'int' from 'float'" in
   interactdialog-gui
 - Azaghal added a class for nicer handling of shortcut key combos. Rewritten 
   InputManager to accomodate the class.

03-Oct-2007
 - Sueastside made some small tweaks to the interaction dialog and commited
   an updated icons image for them.

02-Oct-2007
 - swedishcoder some work in progress on the battlesystem. Just maps the attack
   animation to the attack command. Using direct call to the skeleton in order
   for the character to get back in normal position after the attack.

01-Oct-2007
 - swedishcoder fixed a segfault if strlen was 0 but the str pointer !=null.
   This could be caused by starting the client like this:
   ./client --host localhost --user swedishcoder --pass secret --char mychar

30-Sep-2007
 - swedishcoder added a dialog box when trying to quit the game - to prevent
   accidental quits.
 - Sueastside did some more work on the interaction dialog.
 - Sueastside made a small tweak to location of interaction buttons
   and made Door entities return actions based on state.

29-Sep-2007
 - Sueastside fixed movement for genmesh (needs CEL r3006!).
 - Sueastside added a default answer to dialogs.
 - Sueastside added a work-in-progress interaction dialog.

28-Sep-2007
 - Sueastside made mousebuttons configurable.
 - Sueastside removed client.cpp CS input-eventhandlers and made inputmanager 
   listen to those.
 - Sueastside made entity interaction event-based. 

26-Sep-2007
 - swedishcoder added a script that downloads all(?) dependencies for getting
   started with the newentity branch. Most people do not need this just yet.
   (Linux only)

25-Sep-2007
 - PK implemented the server side of the posing code (sit).
 - PK updated the generator xml files.

14-Sep-2007
 - swedishcoder fixed: client.cpp(174) : warning embedded '\0' in format
 - swedishcoder set "selectedskill = 0" in the HUDWindow constructor. Otherwise
   if the destructor was called before CreateGUIWindow() it would try to free
     random memory.

13-Sep-2007
 - PK fixed: udpconnectionmessages.h(103) : warning C4800: 'char' : forcing 
   value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)

11-Sep-2007
 - swedishcoder added support for stamina support in the gui. Also added
   functions for setting the XP value. I did see some random weirdness in glibc
   at exit, but can't see that this change should be the root cause of it. A
   searched made it looked like there might be a bug in glibc.. Can someone try
   this out?
 - swedishcoder made draining stamina now affect the stamina bar instead of the
   health bar.

10-Sep-2007
 - swedishcoder introduced a simple versioning system. It is now possible to set
   a minimum client version and client version in src/common/version.h This will
   prevent older clients to connect to newer servers. You have to set this
   manually since some changes to the clients should not affect if the client
   should be able to connect to the server or not. Ticket 28.

09-Sep-2007
 - swedishcoder fixed a problem in the gui where an exception caused the client
   to exit abnormally.
 - swedishcoder fixed the movement. Before when moving backwards the turning was
   the reversed.
 - swedishcoder changed the stamina (currently reported as health) to be bouned
   to limits between 0 and maxStamina. Also made it update the progressbar text
   for health. Changed all stamina functions to use unsigned int. Added a
     function to HUDWindow that can set the text of a specified "window".

06-Sep-2007
  - PK removed getBool() and setBool(bool) from the deserialiser.h and
    serialiser.h.
  - PK fixed the client so it compiles again. Equipment::~Equipment() wasn't
    implemented.

03-Sep-2007
  - swedishcoder fixed all warnings about comparision between signed and
    unsigned variables. From now on all ids should be unsigned and 0 should
    identify unitialized id or invalid id. I think there are a few places the
    code needs to be changed in order to get that working in all places.
  - swedishcoder fixed warning about uninitialized value.
  - swedishcoder lets try not to add any new warnings to the code, added 
    -Wall option to Jamrules, not sure if that affects win builds...
  - swedishcoder fixed warning about uninitialized value.
  - swedishcoder fixed warnings where char was used as array indexes.
  - swedishcoder fixed another unused variable, not sure if we need it so we can
    delete it or if that is done by the decal manager, need to investigate, left
    a todo.
  - swedishcoder added the first part of getting running implemented. This part
    enables the possibility of serializing/deserializing bool and added a run
    variable to the MoveMessage.
  - swedishcoder added the second part of getting running implemented. This part
    adds the run variable to the MoveRequestMessage type. The MoveMessage now
    will contain both the speed and if the player is running. The run variable
    here can be used in order to check if the local endurance bar should be
    decreased. In case the server notice that the player has no endurance in
    order to run, the run variable will be 'false' even if run was requested.
  - swedishcoder added the third part of getting running implemented. This part
    adds a function for listen to key press matching run toggle request. Updated
    client.cfg to have r as the default (will most likely move this to shift
    later on). Also made the client use the run option on MoveRequestMessage.
  - swedishcoder added the fourth part of getting running implemented. This part
    makes it possible to run. No endurance is taken though. The animation is no
    good either, and its way to fast :)
  - swedishcoder added the fifth part of getting running implemented. This part
    drains HP points when running and adds them back when walking (in the GUI).
    This is not perfect since it really should be stamina (but that bar wasn't
    there yet).  Also how the lost "stamina" is calculated is far from optimal.

02-Sep-2007
  - Sueastside moved the usage of sectormanager out
    of the network thread.
  - Sueastside renamed SectorMGR to SectorManager. 
  - Sueastside renamed ItemMGR to ItemManager.
  - Sueastside moved effect, item and sector to Data namespace. 
  - swedishcoder changed how float's where serialized. The old way worked
    under windows and debug build for linux but caused issues when building in
    release mode under linux.
  - Sueastside removed effecttest.

01-Sep-2007
  - swedishcoder fixes some bugs in the new sectormanager.
  - swedishcoder fixes warning in eventmanager.
  - swedishcoder fixes warnings in timer and event handler.
  - swedishcoder fixes warning in inventory.
  - swedishcoder fixes warning in eventhandler.
  - swedishcoder fixes warning in command.h.
  - swedishcoder removed a lot of unused variables to minimize the amount of
    warnings.
  - swedishcoder fixed SCF warnings.
  - swedishcoder fixed initialization order warnings.
  - swedishcoder fixed all warnings where printf expected int but got size_t.
  - swedishcoder fixed all warnings printf and (intptr_t) - I believe this
    should work on all platforms, but it would be great if someone could
    verify.

30-Aug-2007
  - PK added networkmessages to support character poses, sitting and such.
  - PK changed the networkmessages to use sector ids instead of strings.
  - Sueastside fixed the client jamfile so the new SectorManager gets linked 
    with the client.

29-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder changed how floats where deserialized. When compiling in
    release mode gcc did some optimization that caused the float value to always
    be set to 0.

27-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder fixed the NPC's rude behavior of walking away in the middle
    of a chat. There might be a possible racecondition about when the NPC gets
    unpaused, that might get him unpaused in the middle of a chat, left a todo
    about it. This is just a first draft of the code, he needs to face the
    character for example.

25-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside fixed the InputManager and made it use events instead.
    Note: There's a little issue with CEGUI swallowing alphabet keys, 
    you have to click a window first, for it to release input.
  - swedishcoder made a/A behave the same. Before only A got mapped to the
    action. Two reasons for having a/A behave the same, configAccess key's all
    seems to be converted to A (even if given as a in config file). Also actions
    should not depend on if its a or A that is pressed, however, shift could be
    mapped to toggle into running mode instead (not yet implemented). While all
    keys still behave the same way as previous.
  - PK added script to create static distributions on windows. Not compiling!
  - Sueastside enhanced PK's script with configurable paths and FTP uploading!

24-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside fixed all style issues.
  - Sueastside moved InputManager to its own directory.

23-Aug-2007
  - PK tried to fix the InputManager but failed. Sueastside wanted the code
    to be commited anyway.

22-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder Turned on the mutex again. After PK's last change it 
    should now work on linux again. This is basically the same code as
    was removed in change 666

21-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder fixed the problem where if at start menu ESC was pressed PT
    would hang instead of exit. This was fixed by using a thread join timeout
    function, just as is the case for win32. Ticket 25.
  - swedishcoder added more functions to the input manager. You can now also
    move around by using w/a/s/d keys. All fully configurable in the client.cfg.
    This is tracked in ticket 23.
  - PK fixed an unfreed entity lock in EntityHandler::handlePickRequest.

20-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder fixed a bug where reporter wasn't deleted at termination.
  - swedishcoder fixed a few memoryleaks.
  - swedishcoder increased the required version of CS and CEL.

19-Aug-2007
  - PK added simple keys implementation and locked the gate door.
  - PK changed the door file parser on the server to use xml now.
  - swedishcoder added inputmanager which makes it possible to define user
    mappings for the keys. So left can bind to the walk forward action for
    example.
  - swedishcoder fixed minor issues reported by Levia.

18-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder changed type on a few variables in entityevent. Before they
    where int, but since both the setter and getter where using float
    I changed the internal value to float as well. This also fixes 
    compilation warnings.
  - PK added network and database code for a future implementation of books.
  - PK added an item variation id to enable different book and implemeneted
    scribing and reading book on the server side. Untested code!

12-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside fixed NPCdialogs so the window closes when the dialog ends.
  - Sueastside moved picking and dropping to the TradeManager.

11-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside changed some window layout to better handle bigger resolutions.
  - PK fixed a small bug in whisperTo that crashed the server.

10-Aug-2007
  - PK removed boost filesystem and boost shared pointers from the client's
    Reporter class in exchange for a leaner implementation.

9-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside applied a patch by Cinquero, updating the jamfiles for BOOST. (ticket #34)

8-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder added some checking to the servers database class so it
    checks for classes that it failed create. However, even more work should
    probably be done in this area..
  - swedishcoder made the following changes to MountEntity (this
    should hopefully resolve thebolts comment about wrong math):
    * If walkTo was called before previous moveTo was finished it could
      lead till that the first movement was disgarded.
    * If getPos was called before the final destination was reached the
      target would receive wrong coordinates (this would be fixed when
      the target actually reached the final destination, but that is
      still wrong).
    * Cleaned up the code a bit as well.
    * Fixed a compiler warning: address of local variable 'tmp_pos' returned
    * WARNING: I haven't actually tested this code path yet. But it wasn't
      right before.

7-Aug-2007
  - Levia fixed a bug where pressing tab caused entries to be duplicated
    in the character selection menu. (Fixing ticket #33)

6-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder fixed a possible segfault in case Reporter object allocation
    failed.
  - swedishcoder fixed a possible segfault in case Network object allocation
    failed.
  - swedishcoder added error messages in case GUIManager, ItemManager or
    EventManager failed to load.
  - swedishcoder fixed a few more possible segfaults and added better error
    logging.
  - swedishcoder fixed a few more possible segfaults and added better error
    logging.
  - Levia added tab switching to the login and connect window. 

5-Aug-2007
  - swedishcoder, submitted fix from Cinquero that solves build issues on
    linux after the recent changes in the reporter.
  - swedishcoder updated the configuration script so it fails if
    boost_filesystem could not be found.
  - swedishcoder fixed va_list calls in the reporter. AMD64 (and ppc) handles
    the va_list slightly different than on 32 bit systems. This prevents a
    segfault in the former case, and should still work in the latter. Thanks to 
    thebolt and sueastside for helping me out.

2-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside converted everything to use the reporter. 

1-Aug-2007
  - Sueastside made a reporter class which writes a log file, 
    still have to convert most messages to use this reporter.

30-Jul-2007

    the client when trying to generate the opcode tree. Thanks to thebolt
    for pointing this out.

    which handles both cal3d and genmesh models.
  - Sueastside fixed a crash which was caused by not catching an exception 
    that occurred when trying to load a font.
  - Sueastside made a background image default instead of the intro level.

28-Jul-2007
  - Sueastside made an abstract 'Command' class which you can inherit from
    and register with the chat's inputpanel, no more 'if's or switches.
    Implemented 'say', 'whisper' and 'relocate' this way.

20-Jul-2007
  - Sueastside added ChatManager and ported everything related to chat.

20-Jul-2007

    - Fixed spelling mistake: passanger => passenger in MountEntity and all references.
    - Changed '>>' to '> >' in nested template argument list.
    - Changed MountEntity::max_passengers from float to size_t
      (I'm pretty sure we don't want to allow fractions of passengers to mount something).
  - Sueastside continued work on mounting and added unmounting.
  - Sueastside added environment manager.

5-Nov-2006
  - Sueastside did more work on the buy gui.
  - PK implemented a hardcoded test version of the npc buy activity.

4-Nov-2006
  - Sueastside fixed a crash when an empty string would be send.

    pthread_mutex_lock() on non-windows platforms in the case that the mutex
    lock is called multiple times.
  - PK changed Mutex::lock() to use pthread_mutex_lock() again so it would 
    actually waits if the mutex is already locked. Setting the mutex attribute
    to PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE gives a win32 like behaviour.
  - PK added a mountentity to the server.

1-Nov-2006
  - Sueastside made some gui fixes.

  - Sueastside added a sword icon.

18-Oct-2006
  - PK made the loader read the items from the data/xml/items/items.xml file.

    to the bug that you can't start two client on the same host.
  - PK changed a big part of the network message handling.
  - PK changed the equip test 'g' on the client to be server bound. Now other
    should see it if a player equips an item.

    the walkcycle. I looked in CEL code and saw that it only works for spr3d

       and also a checkbox for fullscreen.

      entities involved. Do note that this is for testing this
      functions will later be called by a network handler when
      an 'attack message' is recieved.
    - added a few more effects to the effectsmanager.
