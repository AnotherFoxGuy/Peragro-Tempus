<ul><li> I like to keep a game a game.  I think that if there has to be a point to the way the game is designed, that it not be for any reason more complicated than to express academic conjecture.  It's especially true in an MMO game, where players are bound to do whatever it is that pleases them.
</li><li> I like to believe that a game is more interesting if one can take for granted that players are at least a little bit wise, and thus I don't like to think of "powergamers" as their own distinct entity.  Remember, <i>having very good stats, or using rules to your best advantage doesn't alone make someone a powergamer,</i> because a legitimate player may do that as well.
</li><li> Like any decent programmer, I have a fascination for intricacies and complexity.  I'm perfectly fine with game systems which go deep into intricacies.  However, I believe that for any well designed game system, at a certain level, it should be clean and intuitive. The typical intelligent player should be able to have a good basic feel for how things will work, without having to go looking up rules.
</li><li> When it comes to designing a game that is realistic, it's important to distinguish between <i>realistic</i> and the <i>illusion of reality</i>.  A game is a form of art, and the illusion of reality is important vehicle to properly convey the story.  One may have a very realistic models of certain game systems, but remember that a certain degree of <i>suspension of disbelief</i> by the player is expected and normal.  So I believe that of greatest importance when making a game realistic is preserving the illusion of reality, which is accomplished by minimizing the places where limitations of the game technology interfere with the story and game experience.
</li></ul>
<a name="Notes_on_game_designs_from_other_games"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Notes on game designs from other games </span></h2>
<p>I've made some notes on game designs, by making observations of game systems that I've liked in other games.  I also want to preface by saying that I'm not at all opposed to uniqueness in game design.  Rather, any game with any kind of complexity is going to share things in common with other games for sure, so it's best if shared traits are reflective of good aspects of other games.
</p>
<ul><li> Simple, abstract, commonsense mechanics (ie <i>WoW</i>, and to a lesser degree <i>D&amp;D</i>) are good, because as a player, you can basically ignore the combat mechanics while playing if you aren't too interested.  Just keep the intuitive notion that better equipment is better, and bigger monsters are harder to kill.
</li><li> The free game <i>Crossfire</i> has a skill system based on leveling skill groups.  The player levels in general categories (ie, physique skills, holy skills), and can learn a number of different individual skills for each category.  IMO a good balance of skills and leveling.  All players are essentially generalists, but with a bit more focus in certain areas depending on how you play the character.
</li><li> While not an RPG or multiplayer game at all, I thought the purely ability based system which was used for advancing spells in <i>Diib's Dilemma</i>.  The idea is that throughout the game, your character researches new abilities, and depending on which abilities you learn, you are able to learn more powerful abilities.  While there aren't restrictions on what you can choose to research, more powerful abilities are more expensive, so one tends to specialize based on the class of abilities they tend to pursue.
</li><li> The <i>Romancing SaGa</i> series has a skill system where a character's base skill (ie, sword) increases rapidly through usage, and additionally, special abilities are learned randomly while using the base skill.
</li><li> I thought that <i>Battle for Wesnoth</i> was interesting for how it considers differentiating traits to be a more interesting way to describe a character than using a set of stats.
</li><li> Quests in <i>Wasteland</i> and the <i>Fallout</i> game series are nice, in that they are consistently open-ended as far as how you go about completing them.  If there is a conflict of interest in a quest series, the character generally has the option of choosing who's side to help while doing the quest.  Also, the player can generally complete a quest, regardless of if they puzzle through the quest, or talk to everyone in town, or kill anyone in their way, or steal what they need.
</li></ul>
