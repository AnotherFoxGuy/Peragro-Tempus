	    <p>This small island exists far from much of the hustle and bustle of the world, virtually untouched by the great Kingdoms which have lain claim to their home continents and strive for greater dominion. The population of Tal'Anee is, however, divided into two villages. The eastern village, Por'Taem, and the western village, Far'Maen. Isolated as they are, the land between Por'Taem and Far'Maen is rich enough that the farmers of the land can provide sustenance for the populace, though the occasional ship of exotic goods from other places are highly prized.
</p><p>There are, however, two features which prevent the inhabitants of this island from having an entirely idyllic existence.
</p>
<ul><li>First, there are a number of large animals and small monsters which find the various aspects of the island equally appealing and have never been fully eradicated, thus continue to pester and plague the humans on the isle.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Second, in some remote and forgotten piece of history, the villages of Por'Taem and Far'Maen fell into a dispute. While it has been many years since anything large or organized enough to be called a war has erupted bitter words and quick fists are the norm any time residents of the villages meet. Some farmers, mostly those particularly close to either town, are allied with one faction or the other. Most, however, remain neutral- focusing on the work necessary to provide their own livelihood and sustenance to the populace of the isle.
</li></ul>

<a name="Geography"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h1>
<p>The geography of Tal'Anee can be divided roughly into three separate north-south bands. The east and west most bands are mostly grassy plains with some forests, dominated by farmers and the "cities" of Por'Taem and Far'Maen respectively. The central band is mostly rough highlands where the east-west rivers arise, though there are bands of forest at the north and south before it reaches the coast.

<a name="Western_Tal.27Anee"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Western Tal'Anee</span></h2>
<a name="Far.27Maen"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Far'Maen</span></h3>
<p>The newer village, Far'Maen also has a substantial number of docks, though it sits upriver from the coast somewhat and is thus much more focused on the surrounding farms and farmland as its source of food and wealth. The citizens are governed by the Mayor, mainly by dent of his personal wealth. The townsfolk of Far'Maen generally worship the earth-lord Daltaethon.
</p>
<a name="Central_Tal.27Anee"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Central Tal'Anee</span></h2>
<p>About a day's travel (sunup to sundown) from either town brings a traveler to central Tal'Anee. Generally, the residents mark the delineation where farms become less prosperous because the soil becomes too rocky. Shortly after this mark, however, the terrain begins to become rough, ultimately rising into highlands. While the altitude and roughness of the area never actually rises to the level of "mountains," the hills in the area are quite sufficient for entire groups to hide for long periods of time. There are even legends that, somewhere in Central Tal'Anee there is a lost city the inhabitants of which most everyone on the isle is descended. This legend is given little credence by anyone over the age of about 12.
</p>
<a name="Eastern_Tal.27Anee"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eastern Tal'Anee</span></h2>
<a name="Por.27Taem"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Por'Taem</span></h3>
<p>The older of the two towns, Por'Taem sits at the mouth of the Aden river. Ruled by a council of elders which is sometimes called the City Council. This group is currently comprised of 5 men and 2 women. Of the two cities this one has much more significant ports and thus receives the majority of sea-trade. While Por'Taem benefits from the surrounding farms it's primary supply of food and income is the sea. Befitting this it is the center of worship for the goddess Ul'thc.
</p>
<a name="Housing"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Housing</span></h1>
<p>Housing on the isle of Tal'Anee is fairly consistent, and falls into two categories;
</p>
<ul><li> Larger "familial" homes, which have been inherited generation upon generation and improved and expanded as conditions (and family size) allowed or demanded. These houses are generally two stories and have a large portion of at least the lower story made from stone and otherwise improved defensively. 
</li></ul>

When in town, the extra space these provide often serves as a separate "shop" space;

</p>
<ul><li>Smaller homes. Generally newer, where a younger child has sought to strike out on their own, serious misfortune has struck the family, or the land the family settled upon is particularly unproductive and difficult (which is, of itself a form of ongoing extreme misfortune). <a href="http://www.girr.org/girr/girr/000822_farmhouse.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.girr.org/girr/girr/000822_farmhouse.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://lionels.orpheusweb.co.uk/Singleton/Homes/BOARHUNT.jpeg" class="external autonumber" title="http://lionels.orpheusweb.co.uk/Singleton/Homes/BOARHUNT.jpeg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/higher-uppacott4april-06-dn.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/higher-uppacott4april-06-dn.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>

</p>
<ul><li>There is one exception on the isle, the Mayor's house, which is grand beyond the simple expansion of even normal familial homes. <a href="http://explorenyarts.com/admin/db/images/MacKenzie-Childs_Farmhouse.jpg" class="external text" title="http://explorenyarts.com/admin/db/images/MacKenzie-Childs_Farmhouse.jpg" rel="nofollow">an idea</a>

</p>
<a name="Religion"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h1>
<p>The island has two major religions, and a cult which seems impossible to eradicate. The bandits of Tal'Anee are often members of one of the two major religions or agnostic. Any individual discovered to be a member of the cult of Uldagth are killed as quickly and violently as can be managed by any sane individual.
</p>
<a name="Ul.27thc"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ul'thc</span></h2>
<p>Goddess of Wind and Water, Lady of tides, patron of sailors and fishermen.
</p><p>Por'taem is the center of worship for Ul'thc, and where her temple sits. Bringer of the bounty of the ocean and guardian of sailors and ships, the many citizens who get their livelihoods from the sea give regular worship to her. They ask for protection from foul weather and the creatures of the deep, and turn to her priests for warning against storms.
</p>
<a name="Daltaethon"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Daltaethon</span></h2>
<p>God of Fire and Earth, Lord of the Harvest, patron of farmers and craftsmen.
</p><p>The center of Daltaethon is the top of the isle's mountain, though most of the worshipers live below in the town of Far'maen. The priests of Daltaethon tell stories of how the god would cover the isle in fire when angry, but how when his wrath cooled the soil would yield greater bounty than before. It has been many years since the last time 
</p>
<a name="Uldagth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Uldagth</span></h2>
<p>Whence the cult of Uldagth rises is unknown, though there are dark whispers that in ages past it was the religion of the original island inhabitants. A more concrete clue is that "older" cultists who survive both the attacks of Tal'Anee citizens and their own mad rights are warped and twisted into monstrosities with little love of the light and which live underground and attack from the water.
</p><p>Though the excesses and madness of the cult of Uldagth are one of the few things which can make cityfolk and bandits all work together, there is an abiding suspicion between the followers of Ul'thc and Daltaethon that the followers of the other are, knowingly or otherwise, following the same dark god as the cultists. The citizens of Por'taem point to the subterranean spaces the cultists often retreat to while the people of Far'maen point to the fish-like, water breathing monstrosities some have become.
