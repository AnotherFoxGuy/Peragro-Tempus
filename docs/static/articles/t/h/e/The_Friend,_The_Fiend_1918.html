	    <p><b>An analysis of Kvali Society, by Kalen Devan.</b>
</p><p>In the long time I spent with the Kvali people of Dal√°r Vrak I have seen beauty, despair, life and death, all handled in what we Vaalorians would call unusual.
</p><p>I, Kalen Devan, a nobleman by birth and proud Vaalorian of the House of Tabarr made a decision three years ago which would be one of the most important ones I ever took in my life. I decided to leave Vaalnor behind in search of adventure. I found it in the homes of the Kvali people. A people of religion, but also great aggressiveness and distrust amongst eachother.
</p><p>After a long travel through rough lands and facing many dangers, I reached Alanor river with only a backpack and my trusty dog Drahan. Before crossing it I stopped by a Vaalorian command post. A group of 4 Vaalorian soldiers of the House of Karver greeted me and insisted that I supply myself with some of their equipment and food. They asked what my business was crossing the river to what they considered dangerous lands.
</p><p>I told them I was in search of adventure and that I wanted to spend time with the people of Kvalis. Three of them laughed but the other one was quite interested in my undertaking. He took me outside and pointed at a spot where I should cross the river. There on the other side I would find a Kvali village that might be friendly enough to fulfill my request. I thanked the soldier and took a small boat to the spot he showed me.
</p><p>I arrived at a small pier and docked. While taking my supplies from the boat I noticed a tall figure standing behind me. I quickly turned around, knowing from what I read in Vaalorian books on the Kvali I knew I had to be careful with these people. I found a tall bearded man in an animal skin outfit facing me. He was wondering what a Vaalorian with nothing to sell was doing on Kvali land. I explained to him my situation and I felt he understood why I was doing all of this.
</p><p>He had explained to me he too was an adventurer, though in a somewhat different way. He served in the 20-day war, that was fought at the border of Oro and Kvali. A conflict the Oro had fueled. He removed parts of his clothing and showed me his scars. I felt I could trust the man and he said I needed protection if I was certain I was going on with my undertaking. The man I would later know to be Lhargo Breld took me to the village he lived in. As I entered the green colored, simple styled village I recieved looks of disdain and inaudible cussing.
</p><p>Lhargo told me to ignore them, it was the way these people treated outsiders. He took me to his small house where I met his wife and 2 boys. They were warm to me, which I found unusual considering the welcome I just received from the other villagers. His wife listened to my story and took me to a small room that I could use to sleep and stock my supplies. I was glad and felt lucky I had met these fine people. Had I not met Lhargo I do not know what might have happened to me. 
</p><p>After a period living with the Breld family, I grew accustomed to much of their ways of life. I felt it was finally safe to study the people of the village, and get to know some of their customs. 
Day and night I observed the villagers, and I wrote down much of what I saw. I found out for example the strange religious ceremonies these people performed. Each night they would join each other by a large fire, sit in a circle and pass around one book. They would each read one paragraph and then pass it over to the person beside them. It was a strange ritual, but somehow seemed very technical and synchronized. While the circle of villagers were reading from the book, an inner circle of beautifully painted people with long robes walked around the fire. Staring at the ground and occasionally throwing oil on the fire. The robed figures hummed while the outer circle spoke from the book. Then at a precise point in the night all went silent for a short period and everybody stopped moving. It almost felt eery to me as I saw the villagers freeze like statues. But suddenly, a large roar and the people started dancing. Servants came in with platters of food and drink and the whole ceremony transformed into a grand feast. I was both surprised and amused. How could something transform so rapidly into something else the complete opposite. Certainly not the way we performed our religious ceremonies. I of course felt like a total stranger still and dared not to come any closer to these people. At least not at this moment.
</p><p>The following day I had heard from Lhargo an important village notable had very suddenly died last night and was going to be buried later the day. He asked me along and I accepted, though with a certain carefulness in the back of my head.
</p><p>The village notable was an elder, a wiseman who would often be consulted on by the villagers. Obviously he had gained much respect of the village as the coffin he was lying in was adorned with jewels and inscriptions written all over it. We Vaalorians are accustomed to burying our dead in tombs or under the ground, the Kvali however kept the stone coffins topside. I expect the coffin maker went through great effort designing the coffin and making sure it was of good quality. In the open the coffin would surely be affected by the climate.
After a short ceremony not much different from the Vaalorian ones the lid was finally closed, the village elder had earned his rest, no doubt.
