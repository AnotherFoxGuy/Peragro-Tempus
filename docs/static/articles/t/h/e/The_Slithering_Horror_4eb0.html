<p><b>A Lurker in the Dark</b>
</p><p>The following story was written down by a Vaalorian Tower Guard stationed at the Cliff Fortress and still alive today with a particular interest in Vaalorian History. He collected accounts from veteran soldiers and family of the soldiers stationed there at that time.
</p><p><br />
<b>History</b>
</p><p>A long time ago, we're talking about some 20 years here, there was a thriving merchant town called Vaalnor, with one of the greater populations in all of Phoria. Wealth poured into the area at an alarming rate and to everyone but the poorest peoples. Especially the surrounding farmer villages who had to watch every day how the fat nobles walked by pass their farms with smiles on their faces and pointing at them. 
After a long time sitting by and taking all this abuse they decided to take action and formed an army of their own. Their leader under the name of Jhon Grage knew the cities' weak points and that it was barely protected by guards. It had a garrison, but it consisted of men who had never seen battle or action.
John had seen his part of despair and horror, his family was murdered by a group of bandits who destroyed his village while he was away on duty. He served in battle which was not uncommon under the farmer populace. They were used by the larger cities in the Resource Wars with Oro. The farmers were promised money and lands, so they signed up.
</p><p><b>Rebellion</b>
</p><p>Jhon Grage started organizing his band of rebels to make an attack on Vaalnor. He was a captain of rank so he knew a great deal about tactics. He ordered his men to start building siege weapons and started training them in the finer arts of warfare. After months of intense training they were ready.
Their number were in the hundreds by now, when the garrison stationed at Vaalnor consisted of no more than 50.
</p><p>Something went wrong about Grage's plan though. One of his soldiers went turncoat and betrayed him for reasons unknown and told the mayor of Vaalnor about their plan to take the city. The mayor, in despair, sent out riders to recruit various mercenaries from Kvalis and other foreign lands. The gods were good to him with the mercenaries arriving in the nick of time, for the rebels were nearing the city under the cloak of night. The mercenary armies were in such large numbers it did not even matter how the defences were organised. 
Sources say they were nearly a thousand, mostly cavalry.
</p><p>Grage not knowing the mercenaries had arrived in Vaalnor decided to go on with the attack. After hours of horrific bloodshed, the rebellion was eventually crushed. Grage was quartered and his head put on a stake outside the city walls to ward off any remaining rebels.
</p><p><b>Change</b>
</p><p>The mayor and his council organized a meeting two days after the battle to make plans to ensure this would never happen again. The city of Vaalnor was surrounded by huge cliffs. A plan was designed to carve a fortress out of one part of those cliffs. After 12 years of intense building
the fortress was finally completed. It had cost huge amounts of human lives but finally Vaalnor could be rest assured that they would never again be overtaken by force. A professional army was organized and stationed all over Vaalnor, including an immense portion in the cliffside fortress.
</p><p><b>The Horror</b>
</p><p>The Fortress was a dark and cold place, people would disappear never to be seen again. Other times the workers would find bodies of their friends or indistinguishable workers without limbs, heads, and other times sucked out to the bone. These were usually found in the darker areas of the caves. The workers avoided those at any cost, and even today some parts of the cliffs are still never touched or seen by human hand or eye.
</p><p>Stories went around about a large formless creature living in the dark places. The foremen laughed off these stories and denied them as fiction. The workers however knew better.
</p><p>Over time when the building was coming to a close, the stories went forgotten.
After the building was completed, a large garrison was stationed in the fortress. Months went by, the soldiers trained well and seemed happy about their new station. 
</p><p>After a while however the disappearances and killings started happening again, only this time to the soldiers. The captains tried to keep calm in the fortress by dismissing the rumors that went around about a monster living in the caves. The soldiers however knew better and started to neglect their duty and stayed away from the deep, cold, and dark places. Everyday the Captains would argue with the soldiers about attending to their duties and explore the darker portions of the caves. One of the captains devised a plan to prevent his soldiers from defiance. He would take a group consisting of the most brave the garrison had to offer and try to get rid of the "monster" that lived deep within the caves.
</p><p>Captain Cyrano shouted for volunteers
"I need 5 men, willing to come with me and see what really is down there". A big burly man with an untrimmed beard stood up, "Are ye really believin' those stories cap'n? Ye know as well as I do tis slippery and dangerous down dur. I say those soldiers are just bein' uncarefull of where they step!". "What's your name soldier!" Cyrano shouted. "Harnatt sir, Clyve Harnatt he replied." "Well Clyve, are you willing to join me and find out?" "Aye! 'F course sir" he replied.
</p><p>"Well then, that's one", Cyrano said. "Who else is willing to join me?" A skinny tall soldier stood up, not looking at all like a warrior. "S-sir..I...I say Clyve is w-wrong sir. My investigations have proven t-th" "Your investigations!? Harharhar! What sol-" Harnatt was cut off by the captain "Be quiet Harnatt!" Cyrano shouted. "Continue your story private".
"W-well sir, my investigations have proven that there is something living down there. I-I have collec-t-ted skin samples sir. And I think we are dealing w-with a most dangerous animal". "What is your name private?" Cyrano shouted. "Brem s-sir". "Just Brem?" the captain asked. "Y-yes sir". Very well, are you willing to join me then Brem? "Yes sir" Private Brem replied nervously.
"That's two then!" The captain shouted. <i>Anyone else?</i> He looked around, trying to spot brave enough men that he could add to his already shifty group, but all he could see were down-hearted men who lost friends to the deep dark caves and the monster lurking there. <i>Is there no one?</i> None of the men stood up, the captain was forced to pick 3 other men. "You there, the one with the headband, yes you! And you two, guards, you will come with me". The three other soldiers he pointed out looked depressed and underweight but it would have to do, none were willing to join him. Deep down Cyrano already knew for certain there was something down there, he himself had lost a friend. And he knew that if he were to proceed with the exploration he would likely not be coming back alive.
</p><p><b>Exploration</b>
</p><p>The group packed their bags and equipment and started the venture through the caves. The caves were a labyrinth and it was a dreadful task to find your way in. No maps or directions were ever documented so the group acted only on the feel of direction Captain Cyrano had.
Captain Cyrano stopped at a forkway and looked down on the floor.
"What's wrong cap'n? Did we lose our way? Bwahaha!" Private Harnatt shouted barbarically.
</p><p>"No..." The captain replied
</p><p>"Then what sir?"
</p><p>"Look for yourself, Private"
</p><p>Private Harnatt pushed aside the others that were in line before him, and suddenly froze in his place. What he would find next could have made any of the bravest warriors run in fear. On the floor lay a thin ...shape, something that looked like it used to be a male body. It was missing all of its limbs and part of its head was gone. It had lost all of its bodily fluids, the skin was tightly strewn over the bones. It was a most horrific sight to behold.
Captain Cyrano put his hand on Harnatt's shoulder to calm him, both kneeled down and looked at the corpse.
"Proof enough boy?"

</p><p>"Y-y-y....yes sir, yes sir... my god. Who or what would do such a thing?"
"That's what we're here for aren't we?!" Private Brem shouted in anger. "Did I not tell you something is indeed living here?"
"I believe ya damnit!" Harnatt shouted.
"Keep your voices down." The captain swiftly whispered. "I knew this man...He was my friend and a damn good commander, I sent him on a patrol along with 15 others last week."
"What happened to the oth-" Before Private Djunn could finish his sentence, a drop of what seemed to be some kind of acid fell on his helmet. The 6 looked up and found 15 dried out corpses hung on the ceiling, contained in some sort of greasy paste.
"We have to get out of here!" Private Armind screamed.
"We will continue what we came here for." Cyrano replied.
The group collected themselves and ventured deeper into cave.
</p><p><b>Tracing the trail of blood</b>
</p><p>Going deeper down into the dark caves with only one torch in the posession of the captain they found many more corpses and the floors and walls smeared with entrails and blood. The men were beginning to lose moral and were not sure about venturing on. 
</p><p>"Sir, we should go back" Djunn whispered to the captain.
