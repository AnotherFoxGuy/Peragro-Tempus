<p>Everything is black. Not the black one sees when the light has ceased, or the black of the night, but darker, no light at all. Slowly he tries to force open his eyes. They feel heavy. A soft cracking noise can be heard as some hard material seems to slowly disintegrate from his eyelids. A flash of light blinds him as his eyes are uncovered. Slowly he tries to open his mouth to take a breath. He craves for some fresh air. With a firm jerk of his lower jaw he manages to open it. A louder cracking noise cuts through the silence. He gasps for air as his mouth is uncovered. He blinks as his eyes slowly adjust to the light. So bright is the light that he squints to see what is around him. “Time to give my arms a try.” he thinks aloud and starts putting some force on them. As he raises his arms, the hard rough material at his armpits cracks and falls off. As he raises his arms more of the rock falls from his upper chest, shoulders and ribs. He bends his elbows and releases his upper arms and chest entirely. He clashes his hands together and after a relatively loud bang, looses the hard rock on his lower arms as well. “Not long now” he thinks and starts wriggling his legs. After what seems like an hour of twisting and turning he manages to release one of his legs and pulls out the other. After a short time Medoc is completely free of the stone shell that was once his prison. As he shakes his head to clear his mind some of the left over debris falls from his body.  Exhausted, he sits on the pile of rubble and rocks newly created by his escape.
After a time Medoc's eyes adjust to the light and he no longer needs to squint. He lets his hand stroke through his  brown, medium length curly hair noting that his face is still dusty from the rock shell he just freed himself from.  His hands move from his hair to his broad shoulders and wipes the dust of off them. His leather garment, once a light shade of brown, now a gray bunch of patches, is quickly cleaned with a few swift strokes. His legs, accustomed to long walks, are still very stiff so he stretches and bends them to help them regain their normal agility. 
</p><p>With his strong jaw, broad shoulders and muscular body, Medoc is a man that would be considered attractive by the female variety of the human race. He takes a look around, starting with the pedestal the rubble and rocks are on.  A.. golden plaque seems to be on it. He starts reading “Finely crafted statue with overly detailed hands, feet and face. Creator unknown. Was found in the wilds at December 18, 1210. “ Medoc scratches his head “I’ll be… they thought I was a real statue.” he thinks. Medoc glances around the building he’s in. His mouth opens slightly in amazement at the sight of the ruins he is in. Crumbled walls,  broken chairs, holes in the walls, a wooden floor with cracks, dents and gaps and occasionally a wooden roof support lying rotting on the ground. “How in the…” Halfway his thoughts, a terrible pain shoots through his head! Memories flash through his mind, images so intense they are almost blinding in their own right. A man dressed in black. A young lady. She’s attractive, they kiss. A blue colored flash. Pain. His parents. His brother. Fire. Death. A long journey. The beautiful young lady again, this time in a tavern. The man in black robes, he takes her with him. Fear. He runs after them. Tired. More long travels. The black robed man again. He smiles. Blue flash… Can’t move.. Darkness.
Medoc falls to the floor, exhausted beyond belief. The memories of how he fell in love with Lantha flood his mind. They were planning on being married. And how, in the end, she was abducted by Drazar the Dark Mage. It’s now clear to him what happened. He holds his head in his hands and lets his tears flow freely. Slowly he goes over the facts again, making sure his memories were coherent. “It all happened when I met Lantha. Ohh Lantha.. how beautiful she is. I met her in Longmire Island.  She was a priest there. We fell in love instantly. She gave up her function as a priest on the island and came with me. We loved each other… we were getting married. At the party the night before… The wizard came. I believe he said his name was Drazar. Am I sure? Almost…” Medoc sighs and continues his endless stream of thoughts. “We were about to leave to go to bed.. to make love. We were about to get married. Drazar appeared. He stole her from me, said she had some greater goal in life then marrying me. Lantha screamed out for me. I promised her I’d save her. I went after them, followed their trail. I went as far as Oro. There I managed to reach them. I faced the wizard and raised my sword. He smiled and.. and… turned me to stone.” Medoc rests for a split second. “IANTHAAAA!!!” he shouts. Medoc remembers the sword and looks for it in the pile of rubble.  The sword is there but it is nothing but stone now. Medoc walks around a while looking for other usable items. Eventually though, exhaustion gets the better of him and he starts slowing down. Eventually he collapses to the floor, falling into a long, deep, dreamless sleep.
