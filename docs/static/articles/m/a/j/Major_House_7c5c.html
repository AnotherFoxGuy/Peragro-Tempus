These groups hold the most lands wealth, and political power within the existing systems. It is not unknown for major houses to control the bulk of an area's military might.

<a name="Houses_in_the_Kingdoms"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Houses in the Kingdoms</span></h1>
<p>Each kingdom has its own unique form of government.  As a result the means with which the great houses inject their influence in their respective regions is unique in each kingdom.  The Major Houses most tied to power reside in the capital cities.
</p>
<a name="Vaaloria"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Vaaloria</span></h2>
<p>Vaaloria has three Major Houses.  The kingdom is also a democratic one in that a general election is held every six years for leadership of the entire region.  This leader holds supreme power over all of the kingdom however is always subject to the election cycle.  Only four people are allowed to run in any given election.  These candidates are chosen by each of the three Major Houses respectively.  Generally the house leader runs a campaign, but occasionally will choose a subordinate whom he thinks has a better chance of winning, and an acceptably malleable personality.
</p>
<a name="Houses_in_Vaaloria"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Houses in Vaaloria</span></h3>
<a name="House_Tabarr"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> House Tabarr</span></h4>
<p>Leader: <a href="../../../../articles/t/s/j/Tsjorral_Tabarr_e081.html" title="Tsjorral Tabarr">Tsjorral Tabarr</a>
</p><p>Crest: <a href="http://wiki.peragro.org/images/7/76/Tabarrcrest.png" class="external free" title="http://wiki.peragro.org/images/7/76/Tabarrcrest.png" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.peragro.org/images/7/76/Tabarrcrest.png</a>
</p><p>Characteristics:
</p><p>Loyal to the King of Vaaloria, duty and honor goes before all. 
The Great House of Tabarr holds great knowledge of the world and is only accessible to the higher elite of Vaalnor to join. They are a proud House, training in the arts of Knowledge and Noble combat.
</p><p>Their equipment appears more based on looks than strength and function, with some armor even graced with gold and other jewelry. People who have used the equipment though admire its durability despite the fragile appearance.
</p><p>The scholars in the House of Vaalnor also remind the members daily of their duty to the gods by organizing sermons and preaching, which members are required to attend to.
</p><p>They despise the other Houses in Vaalnor because of their lack of devotion to religion, as Tsjorral Tabarr once said "These heathens spit in the face of the great Gods, may they suffer eternally for it". But most of all they hate The House of Karka te Brovery, located in Kvalis. Assassination attempts between the two houses is of common business.

</p><p>Characteristics: Allied to the House of Tabarr and an important organization to Vaalnor. House Karver is a wealthy House, it's members are usually people of high rank in the military or the elite of the Vaalnor society. It focuses more on gaining knowledge and respect and is often consulted for advice on major political issues.
</p>
<a name="House_Greyhill"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> House Greyhill</span></h4>
<p>Leader: Petr Greyhill
</p><p>Motto: Life and Death, Service and Honor

</p><p>Characteristics: House Greyhill of Vaalnor is a place for the lesser fortunate citizens of Vaalnor, the  ranks are filled with redeemed criminals, ordinary civilians, farmers and soldiers. More focussing on helping out the poor and training in aiding others in their struggles, though House Greyhill is also known for it's brilliant teachings in battle tactics, especially sieging and infiltration. 
Trainers of intelligence gathering, speechcraft and other dubious teachings can be found in large numbers roaming the halls of the House. 
It is common knowledge that Lord Greyhill has a criminal past as a rogue himself, he is looked up to by 
house-members, and he is practically worshipped by the "lower" citizens in Vaalnor.

</p>
<a name="Kvalis"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Kvalis</span></h2>
<p>Kvalis government is headed up by a triumvirate of 3 persons.  Like Vaaloria these each come from one of the Major Houses in the capital city, however instead of granting supreme power, power is shared by the heads of each.  Simple majority wins all decisions.  This system tends to be a bit more chaotic than the Vaalorians more absolutist approach, and often breeds problems, particularly when 2 houses are involved in other disputes. This greatly affects their decision making capacity.

<a name="House_Karka"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> House Karka</span></h4>
<p>Leader: Multiple
</p><p>Motto: Karka te Brovery
</p><p>Characteristics: 
</p><p>To this day still little is known about House Karka, they are organized wildly, never having truly one great leader, but having more, who on many occasions try to kill each other to claim their role as supreme ruler.
They are fierce warriors, equipped in Heavy armor and with huge axes. They are not afraid to fight anything. They often raid Vaalorian trade caravans and research exhibitions. Currently they are at war with The House Kyrag also located in Kvalis, and The Great House of Tabarr.
</p><p>It is said they fight with the courage and style of the Kvali Forests bears.

</p><p>Characteristics:
</p><p>Like the other Houses located in Kvalis, House Kyrag has much of the same characteristics, wild and unorganized; however there's still some sign of obedience and control in the ranks, mostly thanks to the leadership skills of Lord Breld.

<p>Oro is unique in that it does not truly have a centralized government.  It is a crude republic with 2 major houses in the capital city vying for power as well as a few other houses in the region.  Each house controls a section of land, and Oro is unified only when the Oro people are threatened.  While fighting between houses is perfectly acceptable, if any house is threatened by outside houses or other threats, all of the armies of Oro unite to defend their homeland.

<a name="Joining_a_House"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Joining a House</span></h1>
<p>Players who have journeyed from the future to the past will have the opportunity to join a major house if they wish.  In doing so they must swear an oath of absolute loyalty.  Upon doing so they will be granted a magical item.  In most cases this is a ring, but in some houses it is a pennant or bracelet.  The penalties for breaches of loyalty vary from house to house.  There are advantages and disadvantages to joining houses which must be considered.
</p>
<a name="Advantages_of_Being_in_a_House"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Advantages of Being in a House</span></h2>
<p>The major advantage is that you will be granted access to many services and trainers that are off limits to people who do not belong to a house.  The magical item granted to you by the house you join acts as an identifying marker.  Some businesses refuse to offer their services to people who are not a part of a reputable house.  Many of these services can also be specific to the house you join.  Each house tends to employ its own set of trainers and teachers which can only be accessed by house members.  Different houses will have advantages and disadvantages in the quality of their trainers.  An example would be that one house might have the best swordsmanship trainer in the land, but a lesser skilled axe trainer.  For someone seeking specific skills, the available trainers are a major deciding factor in which house to join.  For some, another advantage is aesthetic, as members have the right to brand their equipment with the symbol of the house.  The house blacksmith can handle modifying your equipment to reflect your house status if you so desire.  This gives no real immediate advantages other than aesthetics; however, it does bring attention to your house and to yourself as well which can be an advantage if that is what you wish.
</p><p><br />
(Special skill gained? Needs discussion.)
</p>
<a name="Disadvantages_to_Being_in_a_House"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Disadvantages to Being in a House</span></h2>
<p>There are disadvantages as well however.  The magical item you receive from the house you join has another purpose than identification for special services.  It also allows you to be called to duty by the house head if the need arises.  The item allows their mages to locate you and teleport you to a battlefield against your will.  This could be a war between a rival houses or some other disaster that requires great amounts of manpower to resolve. While you can be contacted, you cannot be summoned if you are currently in the other time period as the item does not work across the temporal boundaries. Another disadvantage is that it is not readily easy to leave a house.  The oaths of loyalty are considered very important and not to be taken lightly.  Should you choose to leave a house be aware that you might have made yourself a powerful enemy.
