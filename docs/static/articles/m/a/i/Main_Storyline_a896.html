<p>Three Kingdoms, Two Times, One Land
<br />
The land of Phoria was once lush and thriving. Powerful kingdoms controlled most of the world, commerce and trade were abundant, and people explored the land in search of adventure.  In the future, however, the land is in shambles.  Once great cities lay in ruin.  The remaining people live high in the treetops, in caves, or in small fortified villages- each doing their best to survive in a dangerous world. Travel from one time to another in search of adventure, or explore the land in search of clues and discover the source of the world's untimely demise.
</p>
<a name="Settings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Settings </span></h2>
<p>The land of Phoria is divided into three major kingdoms: Vaaloria, Oro, and Kvalis.  Each kingdom has a capital city and many smaller settlements. Vaaloria's lands are lush with forests, grassy plains, rivers, and mountains.  To the north broods Oro, it's beaches surrounding a land filled with great regions of ice and snow where passage is often difficult.  To the west lies the mountains and vast wastes of mineral-rich Kvalis. In between lay many islands, and the trade routs which are the life's blood of each. These can be seen in more detail on the <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_Map_cf3e.html" title="World Map">World Map</a>.

<p>Characters will be able to choose whether to start in either the past or future. <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/r/Portals.html" title="Portals">Portals</a> serve as bridges between times. In the future, these can be found in the ruins of the three great cities. However, the general population of the past is only vaguely aware of the portals existence as a result of the secrecy with which the governments of the cities that control the portals have surrounded them. As a result, many rumors can be found as to the portals' existence and power. The people of the future know of the portals' abilities, but the journey to travel through them is so full of danger and peril that only the bravest adventurers attempt it.
</p>
<a name="The_Past"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Past</span></h3>
<p>There are several large cities and many smaller towns. The three main cities are the capitals of the three kingdoms, and where new characters may start. Very little is currently known about the portals, and the kingdoms have been weary of allowing scientists or magic users to research the portals and find out what exactly they do. Upon reaching the past from the future characters will be required to have an identifying pendant or broach which identifies them as a friend. Read more in the <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/r/Portals.html" title="Portals">Portals</a> section for more information regarding these items.
</p><p>This is a very prosperous time for the three major kingdoms, <a href="../../../../articles/v/a/a/Vaaloria.html" title="Vaaloria">Vaaloria</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/o/r/o/Oro.html" title="Oro">Oro</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/k/v/a/Kvalis.html" title="Kvalis">Kvalis</a>. Though it is relatively peaceful, there are several regions of control which are disputed because of their richness of natural resources. On the whole though there has been very little all out warfare in a generation. Still, some rogue tribes stage attacks on the various kingdoms, demanding land or payment. They are collectively called the People of the Waste although they have no actual allegiance to one another.
</p>
<a name="The_Future"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> The Future </span></h3>
<p>Humanity is scattered and the civilization that once thrived has been smashed. Verdant lands have become wastes, and tamed regions have grown wild. Villages are scattered in deep forests, the remnants of those shattered cities least infested by the invaders, and caves both natural and man made. Of these settlements only three are large enough to be called "cities," and characters will be able to choose which of these three settlements they wish to start at.
</p><p>The landscape is torn and broken, covered in signs of great physical and mystic battles. It is believed that these are signs of the dying kingdoms struggling against the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/v/Invaders.html" title="Invaders">Invaders</a> left in the wake of the cataclysm, though others whisper that these battles were fought against one another and somehow lead to the cataclysm. However, what is certain is that the three kingdoms have completely collapsed and many of the remaining humans have moved far inland.
</p><p>Some have taken to the great forests, making safer residence in the forest canopy, building their houses far from the dangers of the ground below. Instead of roads, houses and other buildings are connected by rope bridges, and there are a few hand powered elevators to take you to the ground below or to hoist goods to the treetops. Others have burrowed deep within the earth, living in natural caverns and the mines they once plumbed for mineral riches. But, when traversing the land danger can come suddenly from any direction and with very little warning.
</p><p>The three main portals, each of which is found in the ruins of one of the capital cities of the kingdoms of the past, are extremely difficult to reach. The Invaders, either through design or an instinctive draw to try and return home, have effectively taken control of the three known portals. Making reaching the portals in order to traverse to the past nearly impossible without great skill, strength, and luck. No new or unguarded portals have been found.
</p><p>Some clues as to the past remain. Groups of intrepid travelers who braved the portals to explore the future have left journals of their travels and discoveries for you to find. Exploring ruins can also bring clues as to the glorious kingdoms of the past and hints as to the cause of their demise.
