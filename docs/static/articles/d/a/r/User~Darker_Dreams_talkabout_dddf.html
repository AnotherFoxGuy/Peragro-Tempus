<a name="Significant_Changes_to_the_Setting"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Significant Changes to the Setting </span></h1>
<p>I have been reflecting on the shape of the game setting as it stands, and have some thoughts. While I very much like the general shape of the basic setting that has already been created I see some points that are, or will become, problems. If there is no major hue and cry I'll begin the necessarry rewrite(s) to bring the written material into line with the modifications I am proposing. These modifications come in two parts;
</p>
<a name="1.29_Break_up_the_landmass."></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">1) Break up the landmass.</span></h2>
<p>This is an effort to prevent a long-term problem which relates to ongoing development. A major point of the PT game is the dual-times, which centers on the three portals and their associated kingdoms. Because of this, much of the action will be centered in the space between those kingdoms- and area defined by a triangle with corners at each portal. I've come to call this area the "holy triangle" because it is within this area that the game will naturally focus.
</p><p>The problem which I foresee arising is that of needing to expand. If the three kingdoms share a continent the area in, and around, the triangle is sharply limited and defined from the outset. Any expansion to the game will innately draw away from the basic focus, or suck. What I mean is that if it is interesting enough to attract attention it will do so at the cost of the already explored/expanded areas. If it is not interesting than it will simply be ignored as "lame."
</p><p>Thus, the necessity is to plan from the outset for there to be some ability to expand which either naturally plays toward the focus, or is concretely designed to <i>oppose</i> that focus. It must be understood that when I say "oppose the focus" that such areas will still be playing to the core themes and areas- simply by their opposition. While it may appear that this is the same as "drawing away from the theme," the difference is in limitation and scope. Expansion that draws away is unlimited, and ignores the focus- the first piece (unlimited) being required if there is no way to expand <i>within</i> the focus-area the second piece being inevitable eventually in the case of such expansion. On the other hand, opposition-expansion is limited to a single area or set of areas that are defined by what it means to be outside that triangle. Example; if magic is derived from the portals, what happens in an area that is beyond the triangle where mages are most powerful. What if there was a fourth portal that has somehow been destroyed in this other area. These ideas can be adequately explored within limited space, being forced to continue expansion outside the triangle beyond the scope of these ideas weakens the central focus
</p>
<a name="2.29_Shift_the_.22default.22_time"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">2) Shift the "default" time</span></h2>
<p>Currently PT assumes a "present"-"past" perspective. My second suggestion is to shift to a "present"-"future" perspective. The available times remain identical (a pre and post cataclysm world with highly developed society in the pre and virtually no government in the post era).
</p><p>This has the following advantages;
</p>
<ol><li> It provides a suspension of disbelief buffer against paradox, which may not be present if players view the game from the opposite perspective. A character who sees a change in an earlier era which seems to create a paradox in a future they have explored will, generally, be more willing to forgive a lack of apparent paradox then a character from the later era whose past has been changed.
</li><li> This emphasizes the sense of inevitability. Citizens of a society are forced to cope with their impending doom rather than reflect on glories that were largely lost before they were born. Again, with nothing changed but perspective, a character is faced with an entirely different opinion of the cataclysm that exists between the two eras. A later-era character comes from a group which obviously survived, and is looking to improve their own lot or that of their fellows. An earlier-era character has no such guarantee that the cataclysm left them, their family, or their loyalties in any form.
</li><li> Finally, and perhaps most importantly, by making the highly governed era the "present" you provide an era of constrained challenges and significant support for low level players while allowing higher level players to adventure to the less-constrained "future." The later era is generally described as one of greater challenges, larger monsters, and fewer safety nets (like guarded cities). Even if large areas of the earlier era are unpopulated and thus unguarded, the relative civilization of the earlier era makes it more "friendly" to new characters. In short, I feel the current arrangement is akin to starting characters in a high-level and requiring they earn their way into the newbie zone.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<dl><dd>Part of the idea behind a present ---&gt; past perspective was that we wanted to create a highly dynamic game with a well defined past/living history but with the ability to re-invent the future in a manner.  People wouldn't be traveling to the future to rebuild it, which is really the big part that we wanted the game to be about - rebuilding the world by learning lessons from your past.  Thoughts?
<dl><dd>Living history is great- but hard to do. History generally takes some time to be developed. Also, anyone who goes back from a post-cataclysm present is still going to have to be presented with a standing history. The pre-cataclysm era still stands as "living history" to the future. As for rebuilding the future- people from the future are going to be less interested in "rebuilding" than building on what they have. Here's a question; what in-game (mechanical) features of the past encourage traveling there as anything other than a tourist?
<dl><dd>Part of that would be to get a hold of technology that has been lost, training that might not exist, etc... there would also need to be quests written that span multiple time periods.
<dl><dd>On the other hand, all of this is true of placing the present pre-cataclysm. It also relieves the need for redundant low-level trainers in both past and future. It creates a sense of mystery around the event, which would be somewhat reduced in intensity for those to which the event is history instead of prophecy. It gives better support/protection for new players, more limitations for new players, and removes those limitations for high level players who earn the right to cross over instead of imposing them from scratch on players who have leveled up in a much less forgiving play environment... I'm not arguing that anything you say is false- I'm just saying that it makes more sense to earn your way from a constrained and easy environment to go to a harder area with fewer constraints than to start in a harsh environment and earn your way to an area with more constraints and less challenges for your skill level. <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/r/User%7EDarker_Dreams_6a0a.html" title="User:Darker Dreams">Darker Dreams</a> 06:47, 18 December 2007 (CET)
