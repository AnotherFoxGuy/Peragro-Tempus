<p><i>You open eyes, and blink to focus...</i>
</p><p><i>You look, and gazing back at you, is a bearded face, with a measuring eye...</i>
</p><p><i>A voice speaks, and you remember what hearing is, as well.</i>
</p><p><br />
Welcome newcomer, to Phoria...
</p><p>You sure aren't not much to look at, yet...
</p><p>Well, to get it over with, let me tell you where your sorry self has landed.
</p><p><br />
<i>The bearded man squints down at a worn and wrinkled page, and begins to read:</i>
</p><p><br />
Between the last remaining cities, most of this land is a hostile wilderness.
</p><p>Distorted creatures hunt for prey, and some will think you might be food…
</p><p>Here and there, mostly forgotten, hide ancient ruins and artifacts.
</p><p>And this all that still remains of the things the great ones built, destroyed by storms of twisted force that took a thousand years to fade. 
</p><p>Legend says, untouched by time, within some of the greatest, and most ancient of these ruins, are the Fundamental Chronophores. 
</p><p>Built far in the distant past, tangled enchantments of unimaginable power, were woven into the very fabric of space and time.
</p><p>These eldritch places of unnatural force contain the Hole in Time created by the Separated Ages, torn asunder…
</p><p>But with sufficient daring, luck and skill, you might live to find your way, into the ways of ancient magics, and beyond...
</p><p><br />
</p><p><i>The bearded man looks up at you again:</i>
</p><p><br />
But I have to say that...
</p><p>I have no idea why, but I get paid to read this thing to newcomers.  
</p><p>The truth is, I might give birth to a castle, before such as you gets anywhere.
</p><p>Good luck, take this kit and boodle to start you off, and head that way, it is where the town is.
</p><p>Go on, off with you.
</p><p>If you hurry, the rat catcher might give you a job.

<p><b>Phoria -</b>  <i>pho·ri·a</i> (fôr'ē-ə)
n.
</p><p><i>The relative directions of the eyes during binocular fixation on a given object in the absence of an adequate fusion stimulus.</i>
</p><p><br />
<b>Chronophoria -</b>  <i>chron·o·pho·ri·a</i> (krŏn'ə-fôr'ē-ə)
n.

The prefixes denoting which of the alternate worlds of Phoria are which, are chosen to have meanings, or to sound like other words.
</p><p>In keeping with the tradition of creating things in alphabetical order, the game is started in <b>Aphoria</b>, a world without direction or future, that one would wish to escape from, into the past.
</p><p><br />
</p><p><b>Other Worlds Rumored to Exist</b> <i>(and might be built later)</i>

<p><i>Why bother with this now? Because, if you picture being successful, and having a lot of players with a range of interests, it makes sense that the architecture for modular multiple worlds be built from the start.  (A real or virtual server for each.)</i>

Besides, I am having fun.  ~V~
</p><p><br />
Cphoria - (sounds like C-4) a place where there are guns, and things explode.
</p><p>Dysphoria - A very scary and disturbing place. (n. An emotional state characterized by anxiety, depression, or unease.)
</p><p>Emphoria - Shopping.
</p><p>Furphoria - A furry adult place.

</p><p>Kephoria - Something having to do with heads.
</p><p>Lophoria - Everything underground.
</p><p>Mehphoria - Whatever.
</p><p><br />
(Please stay serious with thinking up settings, we can use originality but we don't have to go too far. PT will have a system focussed on RP and IC play, worlds built especially for certain people is a no-go. Even if this was a joke...

<a name="The_Hole_in_Time:"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The Hole in Time: </span></h2>
<p>Within the Chronophores, the flow of time is forced to split and twist.
</p><p>And at the Tesseractic Juncture between the Separated Ages, existence has a hole in it.
</p><p>The Polychoric Warding of the Chronophores keeps the Hole in Time contained.
</p><p>But the Wards are not completely sealed.
</p><p>To draw power from the Hole in Time, a flaw was made at it's horizon, a tuned imbalance in the resonating Polychoral Shell.
</p><p>And through that flaw, the Phorians stole power back into the past. 
</p><p>With every passing year, they drew more magic than the year before, and in the end made smaller Chronophores as well, to take back even more.
</p><p><br />
And so the fundamental flaw did grow...
</p><p>Until it reached a dissonance.
</p><p>And storms of magic, inchoate, came close to ending all that lived.
</p><p>The storms continue to occur, distorting magic, space and time, though they have faded greatly, in the passage of a thousand years.
</p><p>Still it is, that those who live, fight for what is left of things.
</p><p>For water that is fit to drink, for artifacts that still have power, and to withstand the creatures from the twisted lands, when they attack...
</p><p>And sometimes to fight with each other, as well...
</p><p><br />
Recently, it has been said, that some have found a way to travel to the past.
</p><p>And then there are a few strange souls, who call themselves Peragro Tempus, and claim that they have been elsewhere, and elsewhen...
</p>
<a name="Phaseshift_Magic"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Phaseshift Magic </span></h2>
<p>With the passage of time, the Chronophores shift in phase, and change their color accordingly.
</p><p>As a basic Tesseract has eight cells, there are accordingly eight phases of the Chronophores.
</p><p>Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Orange, Violet, White and Black.
</p><p>Tiny Chronophores can be tuned to each of the Fundamental Chronophores, and will thereafter indicate the phase that each Fundamental is in.
</p><p>Combinations of these can be used to power spells of specific types.
</p><p>Some of the tiny Chronophores, may be used to tap power, detect and warn of an incoming Twist Storm, and other things...
</p>
<a name="Notes:"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Notes: </span></h2>
<p><b>Names</b> here, are created from real root words, and have actual meanings.
</p><p><b>Twist Storms</b>, can age or regress character skills and attributes, change features of the landscape, in the <b>Twisted Lands</b>, and drop short-lived <b>Twists</b> of energy, that can be captured, stored and used, items or even NPCs in their wake.
</p><p><b>The past is not truly alterable.</b>  NPCs gain an ability to change, when they interact, because they come into resonance with the Timefield surrounding the Peragro Tempus.  After a time, an NPC that does not interact with any player, begins to lose memory of them, and revert to their original state.
</p><p>An intermediate stage, would be not remembering, but where a reminder would restore the previous familiarity.
</p><p>NPCs that interact with a lot of players, will remember players longer than NPCs that interact with few players.
</p><p>NPCs that interact with very few players, will tend only to remember the most recent of those few, and not for as long as popular NPCs will.
</p><p>Thus we have a logical mechanism for quests resetting, items spawning (the more popular a spawn is, the less often it happens, and if someone camps on the location, it takes longer to spawn, than if they leave.) and a means for balancing how often a player can go after a popular prize.
</p><p><b>Art development</b> should begin with Bephoria, the past world.  This ensures that Aphoria, the entry world of the present, Uphoria, the tertiary world outside of normal time, and all other worlds that may later be created by the Peragro Tempus, will be edits of the past world, having all surviving features precisely in the same positions and orientations.  Not only can buildings be ruined or destroyed, but they can be repaired, expanded, or altered, and something entirely different could even be built on the recognizable foundation of what was built before.
</p><p>This will allow for <b>cross-time quests</b> that have geographical features, and provide a need for elder players to travel back to Aphoria.
</p><p>With proper devices (a small Chronophore), spells, etc, an object or objects might be planted at an arbitrary location in Bephoria, and with the correct alignment of the <b>Phases of the Chronophores</b> (with color changes), be retrieved in Aphoria or in Uphoria, at a much smaller cost of play time, and resources to the player, than if they traveled with the object or objects themselves, each time. 
</p><p>Other players who are properly equipped, may be able to find and steal such items, if the proper phase occurs, before the originating player gets to the location in the target world/time.
</p><p>Regulating how difficult that is, I.E how long a valid alignment lasts and repeats, can be another control for game balance.
