</p><p>There are many organizations to be found the world of Peragro Tempus. In addition to the <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/j/Major_House_7c5c.html" title="Major House">Major Houses</a>, there are many other groups and factions that can be joined or fought against.  While some are thought to be extinct and you may never heard of others, they will all play a role in Phoria, no matter how minor. When a player encounters one of these groups they will generally be considered neutral to them- unless your actions have brought you to their attention before you knew of their existence. Players then have choices; do quests for them and become friendly or do quests against them and become hated, or move on and ignore them and hope they ignore you. Some of these groups will accept new members with open arms, while others will require many quests for the group or faction, until you are considered a friend and are invited to join.

<a name="Organizations_-_Past"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Organizations - Past</span></h1>
<p>Like most modern MMO games, PT has the equivalent of a guild system. However, it is instead called a Society System.  <a href="../../../../articles/g/u/i/Guilds.html" title="Guilds">Guilds</a> still exist, but are not the same thing most people will be used to.
</p><p>When describing the system of organizations in PT it is important to realize its implications on the various time periods that the players will experience.  The following description ONLY applies to how the housing system behaves in the past, not the future.  
</p>
<a name="Major_Houses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Major Houses</span></h2>
<p>Each of the three major countries in Phoria have several <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/j/Major_House_7c5c.html" title="Major House">Major Houses</a>.  A major house is a family of great wealth and assets, along with their loyal subjects that has risen to yield significant military and political influence in their respective regions.  In some cities, Vaalnor for instance, the house system plays a vital role in the official government system.  In other cities their involvement in politics is less "official" however that does not mean that their influence is really any more subdued, but rather that they accomplish it through different channels, be it military strength, bribery, or other techniques.  I will discuss each major cities house structure in detail in a different section.  There are also a few major houses that, while loosely affiliated with the kingdom they reside in, are less integrated.  Many of these have their own fortresses setup in regions of the kingdoms exerting influence over a range of land rather than through politics in the capital cities.  The northern border of the Kvalis Kingdom for instance has a Major House with a sizeable military which patrols the border regions keeping bands of raiders from the badlands from destabilizing the region.  The house thus exerts a great deal of influence due to its vital role in the stability of the kingdom.
</p>
<a name="Minor_Houses_and_Other_Organizations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Minor Houses and Other Organizations</span></h2>
<a name="Overview"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Overview</span></h3>
<p>As an alternative to joining a Major House in Phoria, a player can join one of the minor houses, guilds, or other organizations. While there are numerous small groups and factions that a player can become associated with a player may decide they want to strike out on their own with some like-minded fellows.
</p>
<a name="Player_Created"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Player Created</span></h3>
<p>Player created organizations can be self managed and self organized.
</p>
<a name="Creating"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Creating</span></h4>
<a name="Create_From_Charter"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline"> Create From Charter</span></h5>
<p>If a player is already a member of an existing Major House then he or she will have the option of creating an officially sponsored Minor House via a charter system.  The player will write up the proposal and submit it to the Major House he or she is a part of. If this is approved the player must get 10 players to sign onto the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minor_House_2878.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Minor House">Minor House</a> charter via an oath of allegiance designated by a signature on the charter paper itself.  Once this is done the player may take the charter back to the house whereupon the minor house becomes official.
</p><p>While this method has the advantage of having a higher success rate, it requires you to be part of a Major House, and then requires you to use that house for sponsorship, decreasing your available choices.
</p>
<a name="Create_From_Group"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline"> Create From Group</span></h5>
<ul><li>Do we really want to make devs responsible for dealing with this?
</li></ul>
<p>If a group of players wishes to keep in contact via the ingame chat system they have the option of creating a group then asking their companions to join this group. The group name will be simple and auto chosen by the server in the manner of "Group1" etc...  The groups will not have any way of distinguishing themselves ingame by name, or appearance.  Unlike conventional groups however, the founder and his companions will have an extra option when they log out of the game.  For the group founder it will be "Disband Group1? Yes or No" and for the companions it would be "Leave Group1? Yes or No".  This allows groups to exist even after players have logged off.  Their main advantage is ingame communication.
If a group wishes to become a minor house then it would need to submit a request for sponsorship from one of the existing major houses ingame.  Thanks to bureaucracy this will not be a short task.  A scribe will read you the application questions (which are generally similar but may vary from house to house).  You will answer until the application is completed.  You will most likely be asked to supply a minor house name, generally in the syntax of "House of ______" and to explain why your house should be sponsored by this major house, along with providing a design for a crest or symbol.  If a major house approves your application your name will be officially recognized.  If labels are turned on in the client, people will see your name above your Minor House name.  You will also have the option of paying a smithy to modify your equipment with your approved symbol or crest.  
</p><p>This method has the advantage of being able to try to get sponsorship from one house if another refuses, however, it would take considerable more effort to get any house to recognize you as they prefer to back people who have adequately proven themselves to be loyal and capable leaders.
</p><p><br />

<a name="Organizations_-_Future"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Organizations - Future</span></h1>
<p>Since civilization has essentially collapsed to nothing but a few small reclusive villages, there are no longer any of the great houses in the future.  Their ancestors however, being of higher stature and with better means, were more likely to have survived the destruction of the great cities and many of the villages remaining began as last chance refuges for house leaders and their subordinates.  As a result many villages are run by councils with leaders who often bare the name of some of the old houses.
</p><p>The housing system works a bit differently in the future.  Initially no group will be powerful enough to stake a claim as a house.  Once the mammoths are defeated (If in fact they ever are) then groups will be able to organize into houses once they have enough assets (which may be land, buildings, monetary wealth, or members).  
</p>
<ul><li>Note: This whole section really needs further discussion.  
</li></ul>
<p>I propose there be an available number of Major House Slots.  This will essentially be a list of the top ranked houses in the Future.  All other groups that obtain enough assets (how this is determined exactly is to be determined in the future and is beyond the scope of this document as is how exactly houses in the present will be formed. ) to be become houses will be minor houses.  Minor houses will be able to challenge major houses for a Major House position.  This grants no specific powers other than respectability of reputation and name recognition.  There will be no other restrictions on organizing.  If the leaders of the Major Houses wish to work together to maintain power, this will be allowed, as well as any other change in organizational structure.  The future gets to define itself from the ashes of the mistakes in the past, so flexibility here is the key.  It would still be prudent to have an explainable means of approving names of houses in the future as well (with a structure like the house system of the past this is more simple as established procedures make sense.  Since the future is defining itself this will require more finesse').  Most of this needs lots of discussion so proposals here are welcome.
