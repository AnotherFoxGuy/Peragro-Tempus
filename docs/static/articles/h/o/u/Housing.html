Player Housing is not to be confused with the use of Houses as <a href="../../../../articles/o/r/g/Organizations.html" title="Organizations">Organizations</a>.
</p><p>Housing will be a key feature in personalising the PT experience. Players will be able to buy a plot where a house can be constructed or buy an existing house. The house will function as a private meeting area aswell as a place for the player to express their personal taste for decoration and in-house architecture.

<a name="General"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">General</span></h1>
<p>A house in Phoria has an interior and exterior, the interior is reached by entering the house through the door. The door is generally locked unless a character opens it with a key or leaves it unlocked. The lock on the door may be picked, however this depends on the skills of the invading character and the difficulty of the lock. A very high <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/c/Pick_Locks_bc8b.html" title="Pick Locks">Pick Locks</a> skill is generally required in order to be successful to prevent house owners from constantly getting robbed. Rusty, used or old locks decrease the difficulty a character has in entering the house through lockpicking.
</p>
<a name="Theft"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Theft</span></h1>
<p>While a door is unlocked any character may enter the house. However, many valuable items should be kept in heavy, locked storage containers such as dressers or chests. Large, heavy items such as chairs, closets, beds or carpets are difficult to move or steal for obvious reason. Smaller items like pendants, rings or food can be moved or taken normally by any character with access. Whether the player keeps these items within locked chests or closets is up to him or herself.  As with all interior spaces, housing interiors are loaded along with the rest of the map so that the player can experience smooth gameplay while entering a house.
</p>
<a name="Buying_a_house"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Buying a house</span></h1>
<p>In order for a character to be able to buy a house he or she needs the required money and not have a bounty or be registered as criminal by the organization governing the area. Getting the rights to the house can be obtained through a Great Houses, sellers or landlords in every city. These individuals or groups hold pieces of land and therefor houses in each city. Each selling organization has their own system and laws. The player is required to abide to the laws and may need to perform a certain quest or job before getting the rights to the house. Systems vary throughout the cities and villages in Phoria. Obtaining a house in a city as Vaalnor will be difficult and expensive. Obtaining a shack or small dwelling in the surrounding farmlands, forests or villages will require less effort.
</p>
<a name="Selling_a_house"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Selling a house</span></h1>
<p>The player can sell the house to anyone willing to buy it. The rights which are documented in a piece of paper and key can be transferred to the buyer. Both are required to be in the player's possession. With the key the new "owner" may enter the house but will not be able to access a number of services or abilities- such as being recognized by the landlords or government or convincing NPCs to make modifications. The documented deed will allow the player to make complete use of the house.
</p>
<a name="Decorating_and_buying_furniture"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Decorating and buying furniture</span></h1>
<p>Traders and crafters offer services that will allow players to buy decoration and furniture. Once bought the player will be given a receipt, the decorations and/or furniture will be transferred to the house interior. The player may move the furniture and place the decorations but will not be able to place them in his or her inventory. Expensive furniture requires the player to visit a more exquisite trader. Simple beds and tables will not be expensive, so that the player may make use of these without spending too much money.
</p>
<a name="Decline_and_repairs"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Decline and repairs</span></h1>
<p>Each house will decline over time and will require repairs if they are not taken care of by the player. The player can choose to work on the house, or hire others to do so, in order to reverse this decline. If decline is not kept in check the house will eventually collapse.
</p>
<a name="Building_a_house"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Building a house</span></h1>
<p>Actually building a house will require the player to buy a piece of land from an organization which already has claim to it (past) or otherwise have a claim to it (in the future this is often as "simple" as building on the land). The size of each plot of land depends on the amount of resources that the player is willing to spend to get it. Building the house can be accomplished through buying tools and materials such as stone, mortar, wood and others. The shape, height and amount of floors to build can be decided by the player within the limit of their budget and skill.
Skills as <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/s/Mason.html" title="Mason">mason</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/r/Carpenter.html" title="Carpenter">carpenter</a> are needed.
</p>
<a name="Important_Skills"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Important Skills</span></h1>
<a name="Buying_a_house_2"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Buying a house</span></h2>
<p>A high <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/r/Merchant.html" title="Merchant">Merchant</a> skill helps in getting the player the rights to buy the house through selling organizations. This skill also applies to buying furniture and decorations from furniture sellers.
</p>
<a name="Lockpicking"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Lockpicking</span></h2>
<p>Each lock has a specific difficulty the player needs to get past before unlocking the door. A rusty lock being the cheapest to buy would require a limited <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/c/Pick_Locks_bc8b.html" title="Pick Locks">Pick Locks</a> skill, it is unusual a player would secure the house with such a lock though. Locks, and their qualities, range up to a point where the highest security would be almost unpickable and will only be picked by a character that is highly trained.
Lockpicking a door also requires time, ranging a few seconds for a rusty lock to a significant amount of time for a high security lock. This duration also depends on the skill of the player. In the time the player is trying to pick the lock, authorities may notice or the house-owner may take action her/himself.
</p>
<a name="Building_a_house_2"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Building a house</span></h2>
<p>To be able to build a house the player needs <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/s/Mason.html" title="Mason">Mason</a> and/or <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/r/Carpenter.html" title="Carpenter">Carpenter</a>, or to hire someone with these skills, depending on the materials to be used in construction.
