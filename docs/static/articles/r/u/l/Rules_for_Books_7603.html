<p>Scribing a book requires <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/p/Paper_and_Books_deee.html" title="Paper and Books">Book or paper</a>, Quill, and Ink. Also, some <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/i/Skills.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Skills">skills</a> apply- mainly <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/g/Sage.html" title="Sage">Sage</a>.
</p>
<a name="Journal.2FManuscript"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Journal/Manuscript</span></h2>
<p>The easiest type of book to create, a journal or manuscript requires only a blank book (blank pages or a book with blank pages will serve also). The player then selects a quill and type of ink and begins typing their text. As a page fills it will turn until the book is full. (preferable; The font will depend on the <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/p/Sapience.html" title="Sapience">Sapience</a> and Sage skill of the character, low= barely legable scrawl, high sapience+scribe= wide range of calligraphic and legable fonts.)
</p><p>Books that have been used for multiple purposes will fill from front to back, meaning using it as a Manual then adding text as a journal places the journal text after the Manual control page.

<a name="Manual"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Manual</span></h2>
<p>Manuals are imbued with the ability to grant experience, much like a character using the <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">Teacher</a> skill. The most complex books to create in terms of skill requirements, these books require a character to possess the <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/g/Sage.html" title="Sage">Sage</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">Teacher</a>, and the <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/i/Skill.html" title="Skill">skill</a> to be instructed.
</p>
<a name="Creating_Manuals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Creating Manuals</span></h3>
<p>Turning a blank book into a manual requires it to possess at least 10 blank pages. The character then makes a skill check of Sapience * (lowest of their <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/g/Sage.html" title="Sage">Sage</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">Teacher</a>, or the <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/i/Skill.html" title="Skill">skill</a> to be instructed). Regardless of success or failure the book gains a "manual control page," which characters can use to study the book. Regardless of success or failure, each check to create a manual "fills" 10 pages of the book. Each point of success a character makes in their check adds 1 experience point that a student reading the book can earn. A manual may never contain more experience points than the writer has in the the skill being used to make the check (the lowest of <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/g/Sage.html" title="Sage">Sage</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">Teacher</a>, or the skill to be instructed).
</p><p>Attempting to improve the quality of the manual, making additional skill checks to increase the experience points it can grant, is possible. These additional skill checks present a penalty equal to the amount of experience already instilled in the manual.
</p><p>A character may impose skill or ability prerequisites on using a manual, the character must meet all prerequisites to be imposed. Doing so provides a bonus to all skill checks equal to half the experience required to meet that prerequisite.
</p><p>A character may also put a "password" on the manual. This provides no bonuses or penalties to creating the manual with a password. This ability is used to limit use of a manual to those who are initiated into a group or have read attached text- those who would get a particular reference or set of references. The password, and a question to prompt for it, are set when the character determines prerequisites for the manual.
</p><p>A character may make a book with manuals for multiple skills so long as there are sufficient pages for the checks. The control pages are simply added one after another in the book.
</p>
<a name="Using_Manuals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Using Manuals</span></h3>
<p>When opening a manual the character is presented with a control page which they use to interact with the manual. The student may make one or more attempts to learn as much from the book as possible.
</p>
<a name="Manual_Control_Page"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Manual Control Page</span></h4>
<p>has the following information; if the character can use the book, if so it tells the character what skill the manual instructs, and if they have discovered that the book has no more information for them.

<a name="Studying_a_Manual"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Studying a Manual</span></h4>
<p>Push the "study" button on the control page. The character will spend the next (60/Sapience) minutes studying before they attempt a Sapience * Sage roll with a penalty equal to the number of pages the subject fills in the book. If the character is successful at this roll they recieve one point of experience per point of success, to a maximum of the amount the manual can provide.
</p>
<a name="Manuals_for_Specializations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Manuals for Specializations</span></h3>
<p>A manual for a specialization can be made much as any other manual. Doing so, however, it is further complecated by a number of factors. First, the Specialization is treated as a seperate skill for this purpose, providing yet another, potentially lower, option for all math. Further, as specializations do not allow a player to see their ranks the player is in many ways blind to their true capacity.
</p><p>When opening the Specialization option for making manuals, only those specializations in which the character has at least 1 rank will appear.
</p>
<a name="Example"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Example</span></h4>
<p>A scholarly character has spent a significant amount of time building himself a library. He is finished for the time being, wishes to make a manual for the carpentry specialization Buildings while his skill is up so that in the future he may benefit from that skill. He knows he has a Sapience of 3, a Sage skill of 6, a teaching skill of 7, and a Carpentry skill of 5. He doesn't know, but as he's only used the Carpentry skill for building assumes, that he has a Building specialization of around 9.
</p><p>He sits down with a 100 page blank book, meaning that he has 10 attempts to make this manual the best he can. His base chance of success for the first check is (lowest {Carpentry 5, Sage 6, Teaching 7, Specialization 9}=5 * 3 (Sapience)=)15. He decides that it's going to be difficult to get a manual worth much at that and decides to put his intellect to work for him, giving the book a prerequisite of Sapience 3, giving him a bonus of (20+30xp=50 /2=)25, Carpentry 1 (3xp /2=) 1, and Sage 6 (63xp /2=) 31. His total chance of success is now (15 + 25 + 1 + 31 =) 72%.
</p><p>He makes his first check and gets a 46. This gives the Manual a maximum of 26 experience ponts that a character can learn from the text.
</p><p>Deciding to increase the experience of the book, he rolls again. his 72% is reduced by the 26 experience points already bestowed, leaving a 46% chance of success...
</p>
<a name="Manuals_for_Magic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Manuals for <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/g/Magic.html" title="Magic">Magic</a></span></h3>
<p>These manuals are generally like normal manuals, except that they are more likely to have active spells upon them. Another difficulty in creating manuals for Magic (or <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/i/Skill.html#Styles" title="Skill">Combat Styles</a>) is that these manuals require a specialization (spell/maneuver) be chosen for inclusion and the book is created as if it were a manual for that example.
</p><p>They do, however, generally have special names.
</p>
<ul><li>Grimore- Manual for a School, or a group of different spells gathered together
</li><li>Scroll or Vade Mecum- Manual for a Spell.
</li></ul>
<a name="Books_of_Magic"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Books of <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/g/Magic.html" title="Magic">Magic</a></span></h2>
<a name="Enchiridion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Enchiridion</span></h3>
<p>These texts are used for <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/g/Magic.html#Breaking_Up_Research" title="Magic">breaking up research into a spell</a>.
</p><p>An Enchiridon requires no special skill or check to create, aside from the creation of the potential spell itself. The base information for the potential spell occupies a number of pages equal to the spell's base penalty, not counting any <i>bonuses</i> from material components. If the spell has no penalty, or a bonus, the spell occupies one page.
</p><p>Each point of completed research fills a page, so Enchiridons can be quite large.
</p>
<a name="Scroll"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Scroll</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes called vade mecum, especially when not formed as a single, long page. These act as a <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/o/Book.html#Manual" class="mw-redirect" title="Book">manual</a> for a spell.
</p>
<a name="Grimore"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Grimore</span></h3>
<p>A type of <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/o/Book.html#Manual" class="mw-redirect" title="Book">manual</a>, often a "spellbook," in which manuals for multiple spells have been written. Sometimes, literally, a collection of scrolls bound into a book.
</p><p>Manuals for a "school" of magic are also called Grimores.
