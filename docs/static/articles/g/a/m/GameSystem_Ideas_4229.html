<a name="Player_level"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Player level </span></h2>
<p>Levels in the traditional ways seem unrealistic.
A player level 10 is better at everything compared to a player at level 5.
It appears more logical to have a level for each skill.
</p><p>Since the players are used to have an overall level. A reference level could be calculated by adding the learned skills together. This makes it easier for the player to compare themself with others.
</p>
<ul><li>PT is being designed not to use character "levels," focusing instead on a system of <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/i/Skills.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Skills">skills</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/a/b/i/Abilities.html" title="Abilities">Abilities</a> unconnected to class or level.
</li></ul>
<a name="Experience_Gain"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Experience Gain </span></h2>
<a name="Activity_based_experience"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Activity based experience </span></h4>
<p>When you do X then you learn X and nothing else.
</p><p>You can't get better at mining if you fight all day long.
And you cannot improve your sword skills if you only cast magic attacks.
</p><p>For each attack with a sword, the player gets a little practice. Even if the attack wasn't successful (learn from your mistakes).
The more a player is running, the more endurance he will gain.
</p>
<ul><li> This is the structure PT is planning on moving forward with, using a system of skill use generating experience to determine <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Progression.html" title="Progression">Progression</a>.
</li></ul>
<a name="Theoretical_knowledge"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Theoretical knowledge </span></h4>
<p>Studying can be more efficient than simply trying for some skills (like herbalism or so). 
Therefore it is possible to gain experience by learning from a master. 
This master would mostly want some money or other reward (quests) for the lessons.
</p>
<ul><li> All skills can benefit to some degree from directed instruction, whether this is theoretical instruction for <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/r/Herbalist.html" title="Herbalist">Herbalist</a> or hands on training for <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/i/Skills.html#Combat" class="mw-redirect" title="Skills">Combat skills</a>. This is addressed most directly through the <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/a/Teacher.html" title="Teacher">Teacher</a> skill, though the <a href="../../../../articles/r/u/l/Rules_for_Books_7603.html" title="Rules for Books">Rules for Books</a> provide a supplement to that structure. 
</li></ul>
<a name="Combination"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Combination </span></h4>
<p>As we all know, only theory alone, or only practice but no theory at all will not lead to the best result.
Some formula is needed to give the best result on a balance between theory and practice.
</p>
<ul><li> The combination of directed experience and teaching encourages skills to be developed through use, while the <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/b/Hobbies.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hobbies">Hobbies</a> system provides some flexibility to that. The converse is the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/p/Depreciation.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Depreciation">depreciation</a> system, which prevents characters from gaining and keeping high levels in unused skills.
</li></ul>
<a name="Skill_Levels"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Skill Levels </span></h2>
<a name="Fuzzy_Levels"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Fuzzy Levels </span></h4>
<p>Rather than jumping from level 1 to level 2 the gained experience should be applied immediately and therefore increase the level slowly. Level 1, Level 1.01, Level 1.02, etc.
</p>
<ul><li> to get this level of granularity, early levels of skills have short experience gaps. However, maintaining a constant increase to success rate for experience gained throughout a character's development becomes unwieldy- especially at higher levels. In terms of realism, this is not a particularly unreasonable approach as highly skilled individuals often find that they must invest much greater amounts of energy to gain the sort of improvement that comes much easier at lower skill levels.
</li></ul>
<a name="Skill_Tree"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Skill Tree </span></h2>
<p>The idea is that some skills require other skill to be learned first.
</p><p>Example: The skill "Fire Storm" requires the skills "Fireball" and "Windstrike".
</p>
<a name="Special_Advantages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Special Advantages </span></h2>
<a name="RolePlay_encourage"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> RolePlay encourage </span></h4>
<ul><li> If a player was offline for more than 8h and logged out at an inn or similar, he gets a little extra experience for having rested well.
</li></ul>
<a name="Balancing_Powergamers"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"> Balancing Powergamers </span></h4>
<ul><li> Every player gets a little extra experience during the first 4h every week or so.
</li></ul>
<a name="Trading_with_NPC"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Trading with NPC </span></h2>
<p>Each NPC starts with a defined amount of items. It will only buy these items and try to keep that amount of items.
</p><p>That means if a blacksmith starts with 10 foo swords it will increase the price for each sold, so it costs more if there are only 5 swords left and reduce the price if the players are selling the swords back.
</p><p>So it can happen that in one town, a certain item is more expensive than in another. That will get players to balance the amount between the npcs by buying something in one town and selling it in another (classic trading).
</p>
<a name="Quests"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Quests </span></h2>
<p>What I don't like about quests in other MMORPGs (for example Planeshift):
</p>
<ul><li> Quests are constructed.
</li><li> Quests can be done by multiple players. So each player does his quests on his own -- one after the other if they are connected. That prevents <b>real</b> community feeling.
</li></ul>
<p>Ideas for alternative solutions:
</p>
<ul><li> Create quests <i>dynamically</i>. Examples:
<ol><li> NPCs and PCs rob traveling merchants (NPCs). NPCs may decide to go to the next town and set up a reward for bringing back the stolen goods and/or set up a bounty on the heads of the thieves (NPCs or not).
</li><li> NPCs may choose to hire mercenaries (PCs and NPCs) for protection.
</li><li> NPCs remember the capabilities of mercenaries. They distribute that knowledge to others (NPCs and PCs). NPCs may decide to not hire you if you are known as being unreliable.
</li><li> All NPCs can die. If a smith dies, a player has to buy from other PCs with smithing capabilities or wait for randomly appearing NPC-smiths wandering the maps in order to get a job.
</li><li> Unemployed NPCs should become beggars and may even starve to death.
</li><li> There should be a *real* and *not* simulated economical dynamics. Traveling NPC merchants try to buy as cheap as possible and try to sell as high as possible. They need to eat. They remember where to get the best prices etc. etc. etc. That knowledge is given to their children (possibly depending on many factors).
</li><li> Cities have politicial systems. If a city elects a mayor, he decides how much to spend on guards. That will influence the crime inside a city. Maybe we even implement simcity-like features sometime? But it should be on a more detailed level: maybe based on <b>simulated knowledge and experience gained in realtime</b>.
</li><li> Gold mines: may be protected and mined by evil creatures. The creatues actually "produce" gold ores and store it until they carry it away. The mines and the stored gold can be retrieved, but it should not be possible to do that in a one-man mission. Players must gather and prepare the attack to be successful.
</li><li> Such attack "quests" could be constructed by setting up the enemy in some way. At first, we'll probably have to do it in some way like that. In the long term, the enemy (Orks?) should not be scripted, but their actions and behaviour should depend on gathered knowledge (where is the gold mine? How much protection is needed?). So the Orks sit in Ork Town, some just stray around and may eventually find the gold mine. If they get back to the town they may or may not distribute their findings. If you manage to kill them before they can share their knowledge, they will take their knowledge with them.
</li><li> Many (all?) of these examples have at their core the implementation of a model implementing principles of knowledge.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<a name="Books"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Books </span></h2>
<ul><li> Players should be able to write manuscripts. One should then be able to create books from these manuscripts. Why manuscripts in the first place? Because there should be a differentiation between editable and non-editable "books". The final book then contains authoritative information about who took part in editing the manuscript (and maybe how much). To keep it simple, automatically convert a manuscript into a book as early as the manuscript changes his owner. A book should not be editable because it should have some sort of authority (for building up a reputation of the writer).
</li><li> If a player wants to make sure that his book does not get lost in some inventory of some other player, he should be able to donate a copy to a library. Other players can then buy copies at the library. Maybe we could also maintain sale statistics at the library.
</li></ul>
