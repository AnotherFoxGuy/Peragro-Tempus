</li></ul>
<p><br />
Sorry this took so long, but I have been pretty busy with getting a lot of books ready for PS.
</p><p>Organic and multi-purpose Quest System based on Flags (otherwise known as Marks, Tokens, etc.)
This is just a first draft, basic outline that I am sure can use many tweaks. Some of these things are just general ideas.
</p><p>First, we must define what a Flag consists of. Frankly, a Flag is practically anything you want it to be. It is a set of data placed in a character's table to notify the quest/flag system that a player has done something. This lends to the organic nature of the system.
</p><p>I'll break down the basic types of Flags possible. The quest system would look at all of these the same.
</p><p>Kill Flag: 'Character Killed X.' This is useful for many types of quests. Flags can be assigned for killing a one or certain number of one kind of creature in a given time or place. Call it the Creature ticker. Typical hacker quests are made with this, but a creative mind can find other uses for it, such as defending the south wall.
</p><p>Action Flag: 'Character did this.' This is a physical event. They can be many and varied, from knocking down a door to stealing an item to tossing a coin in a well.
</p><p>Interaction Flag: 'Character Talked to X.' This can point to talking to an NPC, another player, or even an inanimate object. It can be as simple as saying hello to an NPC, or more complex, such as offering an exact prayer to a shrine. The most complicated would be player-to-player interactions. If one player has the NPC thief's guild upset with them, they will have the Flag [Thief's anger]. If another player talks to that player, they could get the Flag [Thief's suspicion] to indicate that the thieves are now watching them.
</p><p>Proximity Flag: 'Character went here.' A useful flag to have, and one of the easier ones to make.
</p><p>Possession Flag: 'Character has/had this.' Another useful flag to have in both temp and perm. If a character has a certain item, the flag is created. If they drop that item, the flag would be removed. Other items would carry the flag forever, such as [Once held the Sword of Thor].
</p><p>Timing: All the above Flags can be assigned a timestamp as well. Killed 5 rats at midnight. Talked to Tom at 3:00.  Passed the old bridge at 4:00. Also, some quests would only be triggered at certain times.
</p><p>Fade: Some of the above Flags would fade after a time. If you talked to Tom at 3:00, then came back in a week, it would make little sense for him to say "Oh, back already?"
</p><p>The following are not really Flags, but their own systems. The quest system would treat them the same as the above.
</p><p>Statistics: 'Character is X level in X.' This would just use the stats as a base. The quest can call for having over X or under X in the stat. Health and age are included.
</p><p>Faction: 'NPCs think Character is a X.' Otherwise known as reputation. A staple for many types of quests.
</p><p>Cancel: Flags could be canceled out or even removed by other Flags or events.
</p><p>Passive Flags: These are not player flags, but environmental. If a player does something to an area, even by just walking through, that area can be set to keep track. A bridge can wear out, or thieves might attack every 50th player.
</p><p>Now we move into how Flags are used. Flags create Triggers in the right combination. Triggers set off events, be it NPCs talking to you, or a rock slide. Some quests could be made that do not require you to talk to an NPC at all. How this is done I am not quite certain, but have an idea. They would rely on [Have] and [Not] in a table, with Exceptions as modifiers. I'll take a poke at how a table could work.
</p><p>If the following Flag conditions are met, then the quest or event will trigger. Let's make it a simple quest. The NPC Joe is hungry. We will be Bob.
Have   Exception   Not   Exception   Passive
Basket of breadorBag of Pears   Hurry(you are running)         Joe is hungry
Joe knows your name       'Bad guy' faction +50   Double Life   After 3 (time)
'Joe' faction +100            Before 5
</p><p><br />
This will trigger 'Joe' to holler out "Hey Bob! Those &lt;food item&gt;s looks pretty tasty. How about you bring one of to your good pal?" thus initiating an interaction. If you stop and talk or give him some food, it will give other Flags as needed for future use. 'Double life' indicates you always did your bad deeds in disguise, thus nullifying your bad faction for Joe.
</p><p>Gave Joe food.
Sarah (NPC) saw you give Joe food. (used in a later event if Sarah was there)
+5 faction Joe.
The 'Joe is hungry' passive Flag would be removed for a few hours as well.
</p><p>Now, that is a very simple event with minimal interaction. If a longer back and forth interaction is needed, then something besides the Flags kicks in. The Dialogue Syntax. As I was last informed, you will be using a Select-an-answer type of syntax at first. This is easy enough to do with a branching type syntax based on selected answers or items given. Flags can be used in place of answers or items given to redirect the quest as well, as follows.
</p><p>Sarah: Can you help me? I need someone to paint this wall for me. Willing to do that?
[Yes][No][Tell me more] -&gt; player selects [No]
&lt;flag branch&gt; Check for "Sarah saw you give Joe food" (known in the system as flag405)
Sarah:
Flag405&gt; Oh. I thought you might want to help. Joe told me you were a nice person, but I suppose you are busy now.
FlagNull&gt; All right. See you another time.
</p><p>Other ways flags can be used in quests is if an NPC tells you to do something such as tossing a coin in a well. The flag "Tossed coin in well" would be created outside of the quest syntax, then used as a response.
</p><p>Responses can also be varied by your character's stats of faction. Answers could be assigned faction or stat levels, raging from nice to angry for faction, or awed to condescending for stats.
</p><p>Ask Tom for a job.
Tom:
Stat-0/50STR&gt; You seem rather weak to me, but I need to be rid of some beasts. Do you think you could do it?
Stat-51/75STR&gt; Will you kill some beasts for me? They have been causing some trouble, and you don't look too shabby.
Stat-76/200STR&gt; Now you sure look like a strong one! I am sure you will have no problem at all wiping these pests out for me. Will you do it?
</p><p>Other things that could affect an NPC's response would be tone of voice. A player could set if they are responding kindly or threateningly.
</p><p>NPC Tom notices you standing near him for a while (perhaps idling)
Tom: What are you doing here?
[Nothing][Need something][Talk] -&gt; player selects [Nothing] with 'rude' set to on.
Tom: Then get out of here before I call the guards, you layabout!
-&gt; player selects [Nothing] with 'polite' set on.
Tom: All right then. If you need anything, just give me a holler. Many a good thing in my shop.
