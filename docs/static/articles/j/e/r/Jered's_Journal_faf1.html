<p><b>Jered's Journal</b>
</p>
<hr />
<ul><li> Writers note:  The following journal entries are intended to be "discovered" in pieces in various places throughout the land, but only in the future.  His old hut was eventually raided by the <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/m/Mammoths.html" title="Mammoths">Mammoths</a> and mostly destroyed. It is possible to recover portions of it however, and many people have.  As it is of particular interest the recovered bits have been copied a few times.  Its a work in progress in the past and as such cannot just be "found" there.  A bit more on Jered as well: Jered is an old man when he starts his journal, and his scientific studies.  He is absent minded and probably suffers a bit from insanity. At the very least he is quite eccentric.  He is also obsessive to no end and difficult to distract from his work, the only place he seems coherent.  He mutters to himself frequently, as if guests are almost non existent to him.

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Introduction </span></h2>
<p>Its been a while since I wrote anything down.  I never used to be the sort to keep a diary but as I grow older I fear all that I've learned will be lost.  To begin with perhaps I'd better introduce myself... I'm Jered Insumitai from Curagoth.  I'm a scientist by trade, specifically an astronomer.  The stars have always been my passion for as long as I can remember.  When I was a very young child I used to sneak out my bedroom window and climb onto the roof of the house to stare up at the sky in wonderment.  Most of my people look to the skies and see only Gods but somehow when I look into the night sky I feel something different, different even perhaps in my own view.  It's a feeling that the world is large and that I am only a small spec in the grandness of our universe.  You might think that makes me feel little and worthless but in fact that's not so.  Growing up I observed that the smallest changes, the tiniest events can change the future forever.  These things appear insignificant but over time their effects grow and grow, like a snowball on a hill growing larger and larger until their effect is widespread and sometimes destructive.  That's why I started this journal.  I live in a prosperous and mostly peaceful world and yet I have this unexplainable feeling that a few minor events are changing this world forever.  
</p>
<a name="Small_Things"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Small Things </span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure what day it is, I've never kept a calender.  I know it's almost spring though.  This morning, walking down the path from my hut to the brook to fetch some water I overturned a decaying old tree limb and saw the new grass below it.  Most people walk by something like that without even giving it a second glance, but I stood there, mesmerized by these few tufts of bright green grass winding up amongst last years dead and matted blades.  Moments like these are always pleasant and peaceful for me, they remind me that even when something appears lifeless and dead, the cycle can always begin again, and new life can emerge from the ruins of the past.  This is the personality I'd give spring were I to personify it in some way.  It always gives way to the lush and steady bloom of life of summer  before summer finally gives away slowly to fall.  These days the world feels like its nearing the end of summer.  Everything is still lush and green and yet there is a chill in the air that tells you that fall is just around the corner.
</p>
<a name="Doomsday"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Doomsday </span></h2>
<p>Goodness its already been a long time since I wrote anything down.  I don't mean to neglect this journal but I've been incredibly busy.  Skeptics of my theories have been giving me a hard time lately so I've been working hard to find hard evidence to back up my claims. Oh my..Forgive me but I've not explained my theories – at least not directly!  I've alluded with my ramblings and yet sometimes the easiest way to say something is to come out and say it.  I believe the world faces a terrible future if its path remains unchanged.  Something is looming, something terrible, and yet I cannot prove this or why.  In short, its even less a theory than it is a general feeling, yet something deep in me tells me I'm right.  This drives me to figure out what is going to happen and search for a way around this abyss.  I used to spend my time in frivolous ways, wandering the streets trying to warn people that the end was near.  It wasn't until later that I realized I'd fallen into a cliché doomsday role, something that has always been common in the streets.  True, I wasn't a bum holding a sign and waiting for someone to drop money into my rusty metal cup, but I was nonetheless pathetic.  Its what drove me here, to build a laboratory and spend my days working to save the world.
</p>
<a name="Nothing_to_see_here"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Nothing to see here </span></h2>
<p>Probably all of what I write down here is worthless.  I cannot write down specifically what my scientific studies are.  Some  I cannot put into words, but in truth because I've just not been successful.  I have nothing to report thats of any consequence.  In the end though I know I can figure this out.  The goal is within my reach, I just need to know where to grasp.
</p>
<a name="A_flip_book_of_Time"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> A flip book of Time </span></h2>
<p>Its summer now.  Every time summer comes around I know my time is fleeting.  My birthday is in early summer – even my mother wasn't sure when.  Perhaps we shared that – a disconnect from time.  Time is something that is impossible to observe anywhere except everywhere.  I can't reproduce it in a lab, and yet I know I can affect its passage.  Or at least I can relative to my own perceptions.  Today I've been reflecting on time since in a way its connected to my studies.  I think I've decided that everyone experiences time in frames.  Think of it as a flip book.  Draw a figure on several pages in different poses and flip through them – the figure will appear to move.  I think of time as a flip book with an infinite number of pages between each pose that I can experience.  An infinity of time passes between each frame which I experience.  I find this view comforting as in a way it means that I've an infinite amount of time to complete my work.  Its too bad I can't train my conscious mind to tune in to a few more frames in between – the world would slow down relative to me and I could complete my work.  Sadly though, when I'm working for some reason, no matter my level of concentration, I seem to experience fewer frames and time flies by.  The harder I work the faster I speed towards the end of my life, and perhaps the end of the world, yet I see no other way.  Finality is waiting just beyond the end for me, if only I could delay it a bit longer...
</p>
<a name="Charming"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Charming </span></h2>
<p>This morning is a bit different.  What a difference a day makes. Yesterday I was so concerned with figuring a way to gain more time to work that I wasted a day in a worthless dream world.  Something interesting happened this morning too.  When I opened the door of my hut I found a small bird lying on the stoop.  It was very pretty, with many shades of blue and indigo with a shiny almost metallic undercoat that made it sparkle in the morning light.  At first I thought it was dead, but when I bent to scoop it it twitched a little bit.  I found a small wooden box that used to house a few pots I bought in town the previous week, and scooped up a bit of grass for the bottom.  Then I placed the bird in the box and set it in the window.  It almost seemed to sense that it was now safe, and it fluttered around weakly, looking up at me with a grateful eye.  I took a small trowel out back near the stream and dug through the soft soil until I found a few worms and brought them back to the bird.  I wasn't sure this sort of bird even ate worms, but it turns out I was lucky.  The bird ate the first worm hungrily as I  dangled it before him.  I decided the bird needed a name.  In the end I decided to call him 'Charming' because, well... I found his grateful gaze .. well... charming.  I'm a simple fellow after all – no need to dwell on something as meaningless as a name.  I'll keep Charming until he is stronger then perhaps let him back into the wild.  Maybe he'll stay close to home and be a companion of sorts.  I could use a companion these days.
</p>
<a name="Wounded"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Wounded </span></h2>
<p>I think  its been a week or so since I found Charming.  I check on him often and I find myself quite worried about his health.  He's noticeably stronger now though I think one of his wings has been broken.  In a guilty way I feel happy about this – he'll never be able to fly too far from home.
</p>
<a name="Deception"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Deception </span></h2>
<p>My experiments are finally getting somewhere but I think I'm going to need access to one of the Portals.  My home city has one but access to it is restricted to the priesthood.  I am considering traveling to Vaalnor where the rules involving access is far less restrictive.  If I could get a hold of a pass I could spend enough time there to complete a test.   No one is allowed to travel through the portals though, except for a very few special people who are rumored to have come from the portals themselves.  These people are said to be allowed to pass in and out at will, though their destination is unknown.  Even though Vaalnor allows public access they are still secretive as to the portals destination and you are under armed guard at all times.  Those things are of little consequence to me though. My experiment will seem casual enough – I just need to subject my potents to the field energy of the portal.  The result will be enough energy to power a small benign device which I'll fool the authorities into thinking is the real experiment.  If all goes well the results will be encoded into the chemicals of my potent itself and when I return to study the changes that have occurred I'll know the true destination of the portals.  From there, if my theories hold true, I'll be able to...well... I'd better not get my hopes up.  One step at a time.  Farewell for now, I've got to prepare for the journey.  I've got to pack some food for Charming too, everywhere I go, he goes.
</p>
<a name="Of_Man_and_Nature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Of Man and Nature </span></h2>
<p>I probably should have written more in the last few days, but the Journey to Vaalnor is quite long and tiring.  I'm camped out near the Alanor River which is not quite the midway point in the journy.  I'll have to cross the river a little further north at the Ikinah Bridge.  I could take the closer and larger bridge owned by the Vaalorians but its a toll bridge and my finances are limited.  There is something nice about being in the wilderness alone. Its peaceful – left to ones own thoughts sometimes its surprising the things that come to you.  Even though I've been walking long into the night before setting up camp, and waking up early, it seems the few hours of rest I get are far more rewarding.  I wake up feeling alert and refreshed – a feeling I've missed for some time now.  Maybe when I return I'll start sleeping by the stream behind my home.  The sound of running water here near the river is very peaceful – I could get used to living like this.  Looking around at the beauty of nature I feel reinvigorated to complete my work.  If I fail I worry even all this seemingly infinite world of nature might be in danger of being lost.  
</p>
<a name="Crossing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Crossing </span></h2>
<p>Today I crossed the Alanor River.  The river isn't so deep or powerful that the average man couldn't wade across, but in my old age and with the supplies I have with me on the small 2 wheeled cart I'm pulling, I needed a bridge.  Ikinah bridge is barely suited to even the type of travel I'm doing.  Its made only of a few large logs that span the river, with rickety planks tied to it.  There aren't even any rails.  The river has several of these privative bridges along its run.  In any case it was mostly uneventful.  Charming clung to my shoulder as we crossed – I think he was nervous.  I've got to follow the river back south a ways to meet back up with the main road.  Once I get there it should only be about another 4 day journey.  Many could make it quicker than that, but I'm older and slow.  The weight of the cart makes me take frequent breaks.  I've brought along a rod as well – I think I'll try my luck later this evening when the fish like to bite.  Some fresh food sounds good compared to the dried strips of meat I've been gnawing on for the last few days.
</p>
<a name="Reflections"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Reflections </span></h2>
<p>Last night I sat along the river with my fishing pole in a futile attempt at catching a fish.  I think I've lost my touch.  The interesting thing about a river at night is that it seems to reflect everything in the world but you.  Looking down the river, all the trees seemed mirrored in the moonlight, yet looking down at the water near me my own reflection was nowhere to be found.  I wondered if the river had a persona and was only trying to reflect things it thought were beautiful in a desperate attempt at preserving its own beauty in a world slowly reaching its end.
</p>
<a name="Nightmares"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Nightmares </span></h2>
<p>The river was such a lovely place I decided to stay one more night and stock up on a few more fish now that they were biting.  I would have stayed a third night, but last night I had a horrible experience.  I woke up late, or you could say early, I  got the feeling that the sun was about to rise - sort of the opposite of twilight.  Down the river I could see a field of rolling hills silhouetted against the backdrop of the sky that was just beginning to light up.    But what startled me was what appeared to be a hideous beast, lumbering across the horizon.  It was huge.  Well, huge isn't even the word for it.  It was gargantuan.  Then it vanished, and I knew it had been a nightmare.  Still though, it felt real, real enough that I got up and left right then before sunup.  Now as I sit here writing it still gives me chills.  It was a feeling that one gets when they are trapped by a predator and they know they have no chance – its a deep fear that gets right down to the core of your being; a fear that makes everything else seem small.  I am not even sure how to deal with the experience. 
</p>
<a name="Existance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Existance </span></h2>
<p>Its amazing how something like a nightmare can really throw one into deep reflections of ones self.  Being the age I am, I confront my own mortality on a nearly daily basis.  Often I prefer to distract myself with daily activities so that I don't think about it, but never being a religious man myself, I find the concept of non-existence frightening.  I can feel my heart beating, myself breathing, I sense - I feel... and yet somehow it all feels detached in a way; distant from me somehow, even though the world is right here.  I lay there trying to imagine not existing, which is of course unimaginable.  Still though, just the concept alone is frightening.  Thinking of it brings me back to that same core fear, so perhaps we're wired to reject non-existence at some fundamental level.   As I  go through life I try to realize that I can't waste my time contemplating death but sometimes its hard.  I think a lot of people try to distract themselves from mortality in many ways. For some its religion and others seem to just become too adsorbed in life.  Maybe this is why we tend to act heartlessly without thinking, because we are running away from confronting our own existence in a way that distracts us from realizing the true meaning of life.
