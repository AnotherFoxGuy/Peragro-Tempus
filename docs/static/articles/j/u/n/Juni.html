<p><b>Juni</b>
</p><p><i>"Sometimes death is the easy choice." -- Induane Lasumi</i>
</p><p><br />
Juni sat cross legged in the mud.  A few raindrops kissed her skin, beading up like water on a waxy plant.  She held a short stick in her left hand, stirring the small puddle of water that was forming in front of her trying to keep the surface of the water agitated.  She just wasn't in the mood to deal with the reflection of her face today.  Today.  It was 1 year ago today that her life took a sudden and dark turn.  It was the reason that today she sat in the mud.  A light roll of thunder slowly meandered its way through the river valley as she sat there – almost numb to the raindrops gently cleansing her skin.  
</p><p>The sound of the thunder stole her thoughts as she sat there, drifting back into the nightmares of the past she was trying so hard to forget. “One year ago... just one year ago. Soon I'll forget it all.” she thought, kicking her feet out from under her and laying back on the soft wet ground. Slowly she drifted off into a fitful sleep – dreaming...
</p><p>A small baby cried.  Juni picked her up, resting her gently on her hips as she went about her daily chores.  Her husband, Gery, had been up all night finishing some odds and ends in his workshop.  Today was the busiest day at the market and he needed to sell a few things.  A blacksmith by trade, he'd put together a fantastic set of knives – “Best in all of Vaaloria!” he used to proclaim proudly... to anyone who would listen.  On this morning though he was gently dozing in his armchair near the empty fireplace.  Juni would wait until noon or so to wake him, then together they would go down to the market where they rented a booth.  Gerys work was always popular; they were certain to sell out in just a few hours.  
</p><p>In the distance she thought she heard a rumble of thunder. “Its just as well.” she thought.  “The farmers have been needing a good rain.”  But the thunder didn't die out, the sound grew slowly louder as the storm approached and an odd bluish glow tinged the shades on the window.  Juni opened the front door in time to see a bright blue flash leap across the sky, seeming to rip it apart like cloth.  What happened next blurred together in a horrible jumble of images.  She suddenly found herself standing somewhere else, somewhere totally alien – a terrifyingly dark landscape.  Everything was shades of gray.  Even the hills were black.  Gigantic horrifying beasts cluttered the landscape, all standing staring upwards as the sky seemed to tear itself apart.  In an instant Juni was back in her home, standing at the front door.  The lights in the sky faded away, and the thunder seemed to fade with it. “What a horrible nightmare, a delusion, a daydream.” she thought to herself... trying desperately to believe it.  
</p><p>Juni turned to her husband, but he was not there.  His chair sat empty.  Juni rushed outside calling his name, to no avail.  He was simply gone.  Juni felt a chill shudder its way up her spine and her breath came in gasps.  A single tear crawled down her face, finally clinging desperately to her upper lip for a brief moment before making the long journey to the ground.  The baby began to cry.  “Hush there Anna.” Juni whispered to the baby.  She knelt to the ground, and stared off into the horizon.  
</p><p>Something was definitely wrong.  In the distance she saw one of the creatures.  Here, as its dark shades contrasted against the brilliant colors of the lush green landscape, it looked out of place.
</p><p>A dull thump sounded behind her. “Gery?” she said as she turned to look.  Worse.  Much worse.  A creature – a horrible creature.  It swung a huge arm towards her, seeming to come in slow motion.  Though she tried frantically to dodge, she was struck.  A flash of pain caught her ribs and as she flew through the air.  Time seemed to slow down.  She realized that she had let go of Anna – she was flying through the air too.  She strained as she fell towards the ground – trying to get a hold of her. Pain. She rolled over, forcing herself to her knees.  Where was Anna?  She heard no crying. Blood flowed into her eyes blinding her for a moment. As she wiped them clean she scrambled to her feet screaming.  A crushing sound – she turned to see her house pummeled to rubble by the creature.  Anna was nowhere to be found.  She fell to her knees again. “My baby....my baby....” she sobbed. The creature turned and moved towards her – she stared up at it.  As it raised one of its great arms to strike her again, she made no attempt to move.  “My baby is gone, what more have I to live for?” she thought.
</p><p>Arrows.  Many arrows.  One struck the creature in the eye.  A few people had taken up arms .  The creature bounded away quickly, stunned by the pain.  Juni slowly rose to her feet, teetering for a moment then turned to the bowmen. “WHY! WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE LET ME DIE?” she screamed then collapsed to the ground again, drifting into unconsciousness.
</p><p>"One year ago today..." Juni lay sinking slowly into the mud.  “I should have died then.” she thought. Raindrops rolled off her skin freely now, finding their place in the mud below her.  Silently she withdrew her small hunting blade and brought it to her throat.  In one quick motion she sliced deeply.  The rush of pain was almost a welcome change and as her life drained away her lips formed a thin smile.
