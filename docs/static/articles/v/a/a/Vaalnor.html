<a name="History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>WIP  *Note, written as text one would find in a textbook for children learning the history of Vaalnor.
</p>
<a name="Introduction"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h4>
<p>As many of you know, the great city of Vaalnor has stood and thrived for many generations.  While it is difficult to imagine a city as grand as Vaalnor as a mere fortified village occupied by desperate people, it is true that Vaalnor's beginnings were indeed this humble.  The current occupants are mostly descendants from the original intrepid band of brave men and women who founded the city.  Their bravery, sacrifice, and sense of loyalty and honor are the reason that today the city of Vaalnor stands as a beacon of civilization.
</p>
<a name="Our_Ancestors"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Our Ancestors</span></h4>
<a name="Summary"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h5>
<p>One question that is still debated among historians today concerns the history of the original tribe of men that founded Vaalnor. It is known that at the time the tribe called themselves the [Va'l Nor] which is where the city of Vaalnor gets its name. While many of their names survive to this day in common knowledge as well as in the names passed down from father to son, much of their original history before founding Vaalnor has been lost.  What is known is that they were fierce and resourceful warriors.  Oral history still recounts several battles they won despite overwhelming odds while looking for a new homeland.  Unfortunately however, why they were seeking a new homeland is a mystery and no one has conclusively linked any ruins to the [Va'l Nor].
</p>
<a name="General"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">General</span></h5>
<p>The [Va'l Nor] tribe founded Vaalnor after leaving their homeland in search of a new one though the reason is unknown to this day.  What is know is that the search for a new home often resulted in conflict with persons living in various areas and as a result when they finally built their initial fortification their population had dwindled by over 80% according to oral history.  The fortification though proved to be the exact remedy needed for a tired and highly decimated tribe and the feeling of safety helped foster a population boom that really stimulated the growth of the fortification into the city we live in today.  
</p><p>Once the city had grown and prospered for a time they began to exert a great deal of influence on the surrounding areas.  With superior weaponry and ever increasing numbers it became apparent that Vaalnor was a force in the world to be reckoned with.  In merely 8 generations Vaalnor went from a small fortress defended by a small but fierce group of people to a thriving city with the influence of a kingdom.
</p>
<a name="Notable_Figures"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Notable Figures</span></h5>
<p>In the initial years of the founding of Vaalnor several notable figures emerged to lead Vaalnor forward into prosperity.  Many of you will recognize some of these names, and you should.  Many of these names are carried on today by their ancestors. Their leadership brought them to yield great influence over the general population.  The noble houses that form the foundation of our government today still bear these names despite the passage of many generations.
</p>
<a name="Deril_Tabarr"></a><h6> <span class="mw-headline">Deril Tabarr</span></h6>
<p>Deril Tabarr is most widely noted for his incredible skills at inventing weaponry.  While not a warrior in the traditional sense, his ingenuity was an invaluable tool both in developing strong defenses using siege as well as in crafting efficient ways to produce weaponry.  As the town prospered demand for such weaponry increased because the early history of the town was filled with conflict.  Thanks in part to this he eventually built up a powerful and prosperous business which he handed down to his sons (NAME SONS HERE).  This eventually contributed to the family becoming very powerful, and as initially one of the most powerful families in Vaalnor their influence continues to this day.
</p>
<a name="Poe_Greyhill"></a><h6> <span class="mw-headline">Poe Greyhill</span></h6>
<p>Many consider what is told about Poe Greyhill to be something of an exaggeration.  The stories told of him are often too fantastic to be taken seriously by most reputable historians.  That said, he is indeed a fascinating figure.  Despite such tall tales, we can be sure about one thing; He was a highly skilled leader, his commanding presence was inspiring to those who served under his leadership, and he commanded fierce loyalty.  A few journals still circulate which mention him and many note that it was his willingness to fight on the front lines of any battle that fueled this loyalty.  His defining moment reportedly was a suicidal solo rush to disable a siege tower.  Though the rush was successful he was horribly wounded and left for dead on the battlefield.  The following day after the attack was thwarted (some say the men were enraged at the loss of Poe that they charged with incredible fury and routed the enemy in a few short hours) his body was picked up to be buried in ceremony when it was discovered that he was not dead.  His recovery took many months and he was never able to return to the battlefield but he was held up as leader thanks in part to his display of incredible honor and duty.  This lead to a considerably large and loyal following which, as in the case of Poe Greyhill, eventually led to his family yielding a significant amount of influence that persisted over the years and eventually found its way into our government today.
</p>
<a name="Jacke_Karver"></a><h6> <span class="mw-headline">Jacke Karver</span></h6>
<p>While certainly not a hero in the traditional sense, Jacke Karver might possibly be the single most important force behind the city we live in today.  Jacke was a farmer for many years before moving into metal working. As a farmer he had developed a skill for bartering that was quite effective. For a while, he created coins of various sizes and precious metals which he would then be used to barter for the other items, giving rise to Vaaloria's first currency. Because Vaaloria lacks much metal, however, he needed something that would be accepted by those he baught the raw materials for his craft from. Quickly, he became aware of the Trader's Coins, left over artifacts of an ancient time. He quickly saw that if he produced coins of those mesurements and designs, rather than a special Vaalorian design, they would remain a standard means of trade. While there was some hesitation at first, his coins maintained weight and materials so they became the accepted currency. With the formation of the central government he was allowed to continue producing the official supply of coinage.
</p><p>Because of this steady supply of income, he essentially became the first bank of the city which generated even greater wealth.  He frequently utilized this wealth to fund ventures into various new businesses and research, in an effort to keep his beloved city ahead of others.  With a shrewd head for business and technology he not only maintained his prowess and influence, but built an incredible power base which has allowed the descendants of his family to remain in a central position in todays government. His family also is still in charge of coinage and as such maintain a very secure place in society.
</p>
<a name="Choosing_Ground"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Choosing Ground</span></h4>
<p>The location of the great city of Vaalnor is indeed no accident.  The terrain of the area was critical in the placement of the initial fortification, which at the time was dubbed [Fort Eleanor].  At the time there was a plateau near the bottom of the cliffs with a large sunken valley below it.  The narrow plateau made it easy to shore up the sides with heavy fortification and the near vertical drop into the valley meant that an approach from the front was highly unlikely and were it to be attempted would be a simple matter to decimate any attack as the exposed valley would make any would be attackers highly vulnerable.  The fortress initially consisted of a short stone wall set behind several layers of wooden palisades.  A few towers were set at the time but were destroyed many years ago when it was determined the structures were weak and hazardous.  One ancient tower remains on the top of the cliff face. It is currently unaccessible due to its location.
</p><p>The fortification, though crude, held through several raids and attacks over the years.  As the years went on the stone walls were gradually improved and expanded until they were much much higher more difficult to breach.  Despite even being besieged on several occasions the strength of the position proved strong enough to prevail.  This general configuration continued for many years until the size of the plateau became too restrictive for the general population size and expansion became necessary.
</p>
<a name="Expansion"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion</span></h4>
<p>Though a brilliant position, the fortification was not excessively large and eventually the population grew large enough that expansion became necessary.  A new wall project was conceived and a massive wall was erected that encompassed the entire valley.  Initially the valley was used for farming however the soil was not particularly lush and quickly began to lower yield year after year until farmers were forced to move to higher ground outside the safety of the city walls in order to plant crops.  The lower valley was eventually filled with housing for the exploding population.
