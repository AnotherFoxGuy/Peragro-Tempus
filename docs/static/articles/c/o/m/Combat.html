<a name="Basic_Combat_system"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Basic Combat system</span></h1>
<p>A basic combat requires 2 <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Character.html" title="Character">Characters</a> trying to hit each other. They each have <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/a/Stamina.html" title="Stamina">Stamina</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/t/Hit_Points_b79a.html" title="Hit Points">Hit Points</a>, and a variety of skills. For the moment we will assume that neither has armor nor weapon.
</p><p>Player 1 attacks target;
</p>
<ul><li> Player 1 determines his attack chance, which is 50 plus <a href="../../../../articles/a/g/i/Agility.html" title="Agility">Agility</a> times Appropriate Skill (<a href="../../../../articles/u/n/a/Unarmed.html" title="Unarmed">Unarmed</a>, as he has no weapon) less the lower of his target's <a href="../../../../articles/a/g/i/Agility.html" title="Agility">Agility</a> or <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/p/Sapience.html" title="Sapience">Sapience</a> times the greater of their <a href="../../../../articles/b/l/o/Block.html" title="Block">Block</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/d/Dodge.html" title="Dodge">Dodge</a>, or <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/r/Parry.html" title="Parry">Parry</a>. This is the percentage chance that the attack is successful. If the chosen number is 10% or less than the required value it is a <i>critical hit</i>. <i>Example; Fred has an Agility of 10 and an unarmed skill of 10, for a total attack of 150%. His target has an Agility of 9 and a Dodge (their best defense skill) of 10 for a total defense of 90%. His total chance of a hit is then 60% (with a 6% chance of a critical hit). He rolls a 43, which is a hit!</i>
</li><li> Player 1 has their Stamina reduced by the Heft of their weapon divided by their <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/r/Strength.html" title="Strength">Strength</a>.
</li><li> If the strike is successful, damage is then assigned- and the target's Hit Points are reduced by the appropriate amount. The damage dealt is equal to the&nbsp;% required for hit minus the percentage rolled, times the Weapon Damage of the weapon plus the character's Strength. If the attack was a <i>critical hit</i> the damage is doubled. <i>Example; Fred has a Strength of 9, and is using his fist (Base Damage 1). He succeeded by 17%, dealing (10 *.17= 1.7, rounded up) 2 points of damage.</i>
</li><li> The character must wait a number of seconds equal to the "Heft" of the weapon divided by their <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/e/Speed.html" title="Speed">Speed</a>, before attacking again. A character may attack no more times in a second than their Speed.
</li></ul>
<a name="Weapons"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons</span></h1>
<p>Every weapon has certain traits;
</p>
<ul><li>Skill used; Each weapon is associated with a specific skill with which it is wielded. This is defined by the weapon's type and often relates to the damage type of the weapon.
</li><li>Skill Bonus(es); A weapon sometimes gives a bonus (or penalty) to the appropriate weapon skill. Some also give a bonus to skills like Block, Parry, or Disarm.  These bonuses are lost when the item's Quality reaches 0.
</li><li>Reach; The distance the attacker can stand from his target and make an non-ranged attack.
</li><li>Base Damage; Combined with the character's Strength (the weapon's own Quality) and the quality of a strike determines the number of HP the target looses.
</li><li>Damage type; the "kind" of damage the weapon deals.
</li><li>Quality; A blunt blade deals less damage than a sharp one, a bow weakened by many draws has less thrust than it once did. This is the percentage of the weapon's Base Damage which counts as its Weapon Damage. Each time a weapon strikes an opponent this percentage is reduced by (.01%*<a href="../../../../articles/m/a/t/Materials.html" title="Materials">Malleability</a>) per point of damage dealt. <i>Example; A sword with 100% Quality and 1 Malleability deals 15 damage to a target. The sword has a Quality of 99.85% for the next strike.</i>  A fist always has Quality 100. Other weapons can have their Quality improved, however each&nbsp;% improvement reduces its Durability, though the amount is determined by the quality of the craftsman doing the work. When this trait reaches 0 and Durability reaches 0 the weapon is unrepairable, and simply falling apart. 
</li><li>Weight; The amount the weapon contributes towards the character's Encumberance. A weapon which has a weight greater than the character's Strength is "Heavy" and modifies the rules for speed of attack.
</li><li>Heft; Each use of the weapon reduces the character's Stamina by this amount divided by Strength. If they do not have at least that much Stamina, they cannot attack. Heft also determines how long it takes to ready a weapon. A weapon with Heft 10 used by a character with Speed 1 only swings once per ten seconds! However, a Heft 1 Weapon wielded by a Speed 10 character swings once ever tenth of a second. A weapon which is Heavy (has Weight greater than the character's Strength) uses the lower of the character's Speed or Strength to determine how fast it is readied.
</li><li>Durability; This trait is set at the time the weapon is created and steadily erodes from there. Any time it's Quality is increased this trait is reduced by an amount determined by the quality of the craftsman doing the work. When this trait reaches 0 the weapon is no longer repairable. It might still be good for raw materials however.
</li></ul>
<a name="Ranged_Weapons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ranged Weapons</span></h2>
<a name="Modifications"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modifications</span></h3>
<ul><li> Quality; A Bow, crossbow, or other projectile weapon's Quality erodes by .1, any time a 1 is rolled, regardless of hit or miss. Bowstrings, however, degrade by the roll made *.01 every attack, though this can be modified by extremes in weather.
</li><li> Base Damage; Base damage is determined by adding the Base Damage of a projectile weapon an that of it's ammunition. Thus, both bows and arrows generally have deceptively low Base Damage.
</li><li> A ranged weapon has no reach.
</li></ul>
<a name="Additional_Traits"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Additional Traits</span></h3>
<ul><li> Pull; This is the maximum Strength that can be applied to the damage. (this does not apply to <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/r/Thrown.html" title="Thrown">Thrown</a> weapons).
</li><li> Range; A ranged weapon suffers a -1 penalty to hit each time the projectile travels its Range in meters. Weapons with Pull have this rating multiplied by the Range of their ammunition while the Range of a Thrown weapon is multiplied by the character's Strength. 
</li></ul>
<a name="Ammunition"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Ammunition</span></h4>
<ul><li> Ammunition often modifies other Traits of the weapon which uses it.
</li><li> Note that the lower Quality between a ranged weapon and its ammunition is the one used.
</li></ul>
<a name="Armor"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Armor</span></h1>
<p>Every piece of armor has certain traits;
</p>
<ul><li> Mobility; The maximum Agility the armor can accomodate. The character's Armor Proficiency is added to this number.
</li><li> Hardness; The character's <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/m/Armor_Proficiency_275f.html" title="Armor Proficiency">Armor Proficiency</a> is the percentage of this value the character can add to their Agility * (defense skill) to improve their chance of not taking damage.
</li><li> Quality; The percentage of the armor's Hardness which applies. Any successful attack reduces quality by (.01%*<a href="../../../../articles/c/r/a/Crafting.html" title="Crafting">Malleability</a>) per point of damage dealt. Any attack which would have been successful except for the Armor's presance, reduces quality by (.1%*Malleability) point by which the attack would have succeeded.
</li><li> Bulk; If a character is wearing armor there is a chance it will foul any other action the character chooses to take, including attacks (this is checked before the attack is even attempted). This chance is reduced by an amount equal to the character's Armor Proficiency.
</li><li> Toughness; This trait is effectively a pool of bonus Hit Points which are lost before the character's own. Restoring these hit points reduces the durability of the item.
</li><li> Durability; This trait is set at the time the armor is created and steadily erodes from there. Any time it's Quality or Toughness is increased this trait is reduced by an amount determined by the quality of the craftsman doing the work. When this trait reaches 0 the armor can no longer be repaired or restored and provides only the bonuses remaining to it. It might still be good for raw materials however.
</li><li>Skill Bonus(es); Armor sometimes gives a bonus to certain skills, often Block (especially for shields). These bonuses are lost when the item's Quality reaches 0.
</li></ul>
<a name="Expanded_Examples"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Expanded Examples</span></h1>
<p><a href="../../../../articles/e/x/a/Examples_of_Combat_6994.html" title="Examples of Combat">Examples of Combat</a>
</p>
<a name="Possible_Complications"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">Possible Complications</span></h1>
<p>aka; things to worry about later.
</p>
<a name="Damage_Types"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Damage Types</span></h2>
<p>Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning, v energy types (fire/cold/etc). Mostly types attached to attacks from which the damage a subject takes may be modified.
</p><p>Modification of damage through types is handled as a two step process.
</p>
<ul><li>First, each weapon's damage is typed, and may have multiple types. This means a flaming sword might have a weapon damage of "fire 1, cut 4." this means that a successful attack with this weapon will deal (required roll - actual roll) * (base damage) for each of the two types. In this case, dealing about four times as much slashing damage as fire. Similarly morningstars would deal a mix of crush and pierce damage.
</li><li>Second, this damage is passed to the character who may have resistances or weaknesses. These modifications may be due to its own physical structure (skeletons resisting slashing or piercing damage and being weak against crushing and fire attacks) or various types of armor worn. If a character has no modifiers they are assumed to take 100 percent of the damage. A character which modifies a damage type to less than 100 percent of damage has a resistance, at 0% they are immune, and at negative percent the damage heals them. A character who modifies a damage type to over 100% has a weakness against that type of damage.
</li></ul>
<a name="Special_Materials"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Special Materials</span></h3>
<p>Much as some creatures are resistant or weak against some damage types, others are weak (or strong) against certain materials. Thus the damage type must carry the material source of the damage. This is generally irrelevant, as a human cares little whether they are hit by steel or iron and armor generally makes no more distinction than its wearer. Many magical creatures, however, are particularly susceptible to some materials.
</p>
<a name="The_Big_Fighter_Stunt"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Big Fighter Stunt</span></h2>
<p>While one-handed weapons cannot be wielded two handed, a character may equipp a two handed weapon one handed. However, doing so <i>triples</i> the weapon's Heft as well as it's Weight for the purpose of determining if it is "Heavy."
</p>
<a name="Facing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Facing</span></h2>
<p>All above rules assume foes are face to face.
</p>
<a name="Behind"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Behind</span></h3>
<ul><li> You cannot attack an opponent who is behind your character.
</li><li> You cannot use Block or Parry against attacks from behind.
</li><li> You recieve only half your ranks in Dodge against attacks from behind.
</li></ul>
<a name="Beside"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Beside</span></h3>
<ul><li> You can only parry or block with the item equipped on that side.
</li></ul>
<a name="Zone_Damage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Zone Damage</span></h2>
<p>An expansion on combat facing, zone damage considers each part of the body seperately and applies a chance of that part suffering damage. Hit points (and Toughness) are attributed to each of those parts, and damage to those parts have their own effects.
</p>
<a name="Multi-crits"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Multi-crits</span></h2>
<p>A critical hit is a roll of less than 10% that required to hit. If the roll is 1% of the requirement to hit the character gets a <i>double critical</i> (x4 damage). In absurdly rare cases this continues to iterate (.1% = x8, etc). Thus, having a 100%+ chance to hit gives a&nbsp;% chance of a double critical.
</p>
<a name="Interruptions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Interruptions</span></h2>
<p>Many activities have durations during which they are performed. The most obvious of these is <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/g/Magic.html" title="Magic">Magic</a>, though many other skills such as <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/a/Healer.html" title="Healer">healing</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/c/Pick_Locks_bc8b.html" title="Pick Locks">picking locks</a> are examples. Even some types of attack, generally <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/n/Maneuvers.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Maneuvers">maneuvers</a>, can have timers involved with their "windup."
</p><p>If an attack is made on an individual performing such actions their options for defense are generally limited to a dodge. If the attack would have failed had the individual possessed half their ranks in dodge they continue the action unhindered. If the attack would have hit them (using half their ranks in dodge) they loose <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/Willpower.html" title="Willpower">Willpower</a> equal to the damage they would have suffered- but remain otherwise unhindered in their action as long as they retain any Willpower.
</p><p>Should, even with their full ranks in Dodge, the character be struck- their total loss of Willpower is doubled, and they must make a Stamina * Resolve check with a penalty equal to 10* their willpower loss or have the action interrupted.
</p>
<a name="Alternate_Positioning"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alternate Positioning</span></h3>
<p>A character might be allowed to select from a menu of options regarding how committed they are to completing actions (or certain actions). Example settings would include;
</p>
<ul><li> Defensive; Any attack immediately ends the attempted action, allowing full regular defenses.
</li><li> Cautious; as above.
</li><li> Determined; An attack which succeeds against half the character's defense strikes them, dealing damage. The Willpower loss is not doubled.
</li><li> Committed;  An attack which succeeds against one quarter the character's defense strikes them, dealing damage. The Willpower loss is not doubled, and the penalty to the Stamina * Resolve check to complete the action is simply the lost Willpower.
</li></ul>
<a name="Mounted_Combat"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mounted Combat</span></h2>
<p>Fighting from horseback is generally, but not always, the same as fighting on foot. Need some rules to handle the obstacles that relate, to deal with maneuvers horses may perform (desired and undesired), and unique weapons/interactions (ie; lance from horseback or pike/spear against a rider/horse).
