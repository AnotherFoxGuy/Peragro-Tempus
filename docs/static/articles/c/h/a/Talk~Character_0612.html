<ul><li> I'd like to have this all easily configurable. I, for example, think of a world where there is no non-utilization-effect, but where the overall skill sum is harshly limited (wrestlers cant be mages or something like that). Additionally, I don't like games where you have to spend hours over hours in developing your avatar. That is a waste of time. A game should not attract players by supporting their ego, but by an interesting setting. Please put the corresponding rules into XML files or something similar that is not hard-coded.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Moved comment here from the front page. As a thing, if you limit total the ability of characters to broaden abilities than you push people into classes- they will simply be unnamed, informal classes. On the other hand, a player should be able to spend as much time as they want tweeking their avatar. I probably would spend the minimum possible, and that should be pretty short, but if coding customization doesn't take from other, more important, things- than saying that someone's preference for a highly personalized avatar is wasted time simply cuts away potential players for no gain. <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/r/User%7EDarker_Dreams_6a0a.html" title="User:Darker Dreams">Darker Dreams</a> 08:12, 12 December 2007 (CET)

<a name="Hp.2FWp.2FStamina"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Hp/Wp/Stamina </span></h2>
<p>Currently the assumption that I'm working with is that maximum Hit Points, Willpower (or whatever "mental hit points" will be called), and Stamina are simply equal to abilities from which they are derived plus any bonuses from equippment. While armor and other considerations make this a workable solution for Hit Points, this quickly becomes unsatisfactory for Wp and Sta- which have no clear analogue for enhancement. Normally, these three derived statistics would be determined by the intersection of multiple variables, often including Ability, Level, and Class. As PT has neither Class nor Level this becomes difficult. In many ways skill rank/level can and will replace the classic "character level" for these sorts of calculations- however there is no elegant solution for these derived resources.
</p><p>options I see;
</p>
<ol><li> Leave as is- these numbers increase as the stat increases. For things that burn more frequently (Sta/Wp) use smaller increments (.1 or .01) instead of whole numbers or multiply the base value by 10 or 100 to get the same effect while presenting the illusion of whole numbers.
</li><li> Create new skills- An Athletics skill might add or multiply against <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/d/Endurance.html" title="Endurance">Endurance</a> to determine Stamina. A similar skill against <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/p/Sapience.html" title="Sapience">Sapience</a> for willpower, and a third (perhaps, if higher HP is desired) working with Endurance again for Hit Points. Presuming that this is the primary use, these skills could be checked- soley to determine Xp generation -each time a point of HP/WP/Sta is restored (as appropriate). (Use restoration instead of damage to prevent the oddness of getting more HP from being hurt). Other uses could be found for these skills... however, it encourages skill proliferation which can quickly become unwieldy.
</li></ol>

<a name="Stamina_use"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Stamina use </span></h2>
<p>I was talking to <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/d/User%7EInduane_ae61.html" title="User:Induane">User:Induane</a> and he made a comment about not liking how must MMOGs use stamina and then simply forbid actions that use stamina until it replenishes somewhat. I had an alternate idea; link Sta and HP.
</p><p>The way this would work is;
</p>
<ul><li> If Sta dropped below 0 Hp would be reduced by 1 and current Sta would be increased by Max Sta (thus it would be Max minus whatever was used below 0).
</li><li> Similarly, if Sta tried to raise above Max Sta, the system would check if Hp was less than Max Hp. If so, Sta would be decreased by Max Sta and Hp would increase by 1.
</li></ul>
<p>Thus, a character could literally run themselves to death- though they get clear warning that's what they are doing. They could exhaust themselves fighting, but not simply be required to stand there until Stamina regenerates.
