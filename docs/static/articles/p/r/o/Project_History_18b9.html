<a name="The_beginning"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> The beginning </span></h1>
<p>At the beginning of the year two thousand and five a group of projects started talking about coming together to form one new joint project. The original projects were <i>Bringer of Light</i>, <i>Hell</i> and <i>the Oracle of the Hidden</i>. Each project had a slightly different goal, though the main red line connecting all three projects was to make a Role Playing Game. The variation between these was mostly the type of play; whether to focus on the ability to play on-line, off-line, or story. However, all three project intended to use the Crystal Space 3D software development kit.
</p><p><br />
Since <i>Bringer of Light</i> consisted mostly of coders, <i>Hell</i> was mostly artists, and <i>the Oracle of the Hidden</i> project had mostly settings and game systems developers it was logical for them to merge or at least try to work together.
</p><p><br />
<i>Bringer of Light</i> and <i>Hell</i> had been talking a bit longer about merging, and thus were the first to think about a new name for their combined project. They choose <i>Peragro Tempus</i> as a name and registered the IRC channel #peragro shortly after, on January the 14<sup>th</sup> 2005. Since all previous dates are vague and clear milestones hard to identify, this date has been chosen to be the birth of Peragro Tempus.
</p>
<a name="The_first_years"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> The first years </span></h1>
<p>In the first year many things happened. We first started of with the code base from <i>the Oracle of the Hidden</i> project which was based on the <i>Crystal Core</i> game (which at that time was very new). After a few months of meddling with that we decided to start with a complete clean slate and work from there. The art, story and ideas stayed. This restart set us back quite a bit since we had to build everything up from the ground, however it also gave us more flexibility. 
</p><p><br />
In the first year many people came and helped for a very short time, or said that they would help. Many of them never did anything, however. This was very frustrating and took its toll on the central contributors morale. After working on PT for a while people started to work less or had other things to do. Rumours began spreading about Peragro Tempus being a dead-end project. At this very unstable time it became clear who really wanted Peragro Tempus to succeed and they became known as the project founders.
</p><p><br />
Managing Peragro Tempus was not easy in that first year. There was no clear definition of how things should be done nor were we sure about how we would work at our fullest capacity. This resulted in a very difficult time, since management changed quite a bit from being very loose to very strict with rules, deadlines, and other things hoping to enforce people working. Fortunately, this changed in the years that followed.
</p><p><br />
After a "period of no activity" people started talking again, work started gradually reappearing, and new people came to help. A number of people, unhappy with incidents that had occurred with them when interacting with a similar project <i>PlaneShift</i>, started showing up in our channel. It was also during this period that a decision was made to make Peragro Tempus completely open/libre.
</p>
<a name="The_years_that_followed"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> The years that followed </span></h1>
<p>As with all projects, people come and go. Fortunate for Peragro Tempus that initial stream of new blood stayed, and has remained continuous. The awful "period of no activity" has not returned and thus momentum continues to gather and progress keeps getting faster and faster. "Management" now mostly consists of pointing people to the right directions and not bothering too much with rules. This has made the project form a sort of mutual understanding between members about who does what. No longer is there any need for people to leave Peragro Tempus. The only thing that can stop Peragro Tempus from becoming a playable and enjoyable game is the end of the world and all life on it. No matter who leaves the team there will always be someone to replace that person.
</p>
<a name="The_future"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> The future </span></h1>
<p>Since some of us have the ability of foresight we can already continue this article about the history of Peragro Tempus. People all around the world will notice a new game. Not too technologically advanced but quite enjoyable to play. This group of people starts growing and growing until it is clear that not only commercial games can have player counts in the millions and that the open source / libre software industry is actually quite profitable if done right. Not profitable in money ... no profitable in feeling happy, having created a new atmosphere and the satisfaction of all the people involved in creating and still continue expanding the world of Peragro Tempus.
</p><p><br />
It is also said that the most visited holographic world in the years far beyond now is the same as the one we here see as a small computer game but expanded upon by millions of beings from many races.
