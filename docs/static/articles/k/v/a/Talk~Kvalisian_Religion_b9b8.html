	    <p>Couple key points.
</p><p>1.) Do we want to refer to the religions or beliefs of any one culture as "mythology"? Valbrandr pointed out that that assumes that their religions and beliefs are by default false.
</p><p>2.) What voice do we want to be expressing this from?  The Kvalis(Kvalians?) believe that X Y and Z or do we want to state things as factual: X, Y, Z as if it were being expressed by true believers who would absolutely consider it fact.
</p><p>I think we should go that route. Thats the goal of fantasy sometimes. Those things that "could" happen or almost sound feasible. In my opinion, the religion section will sound better if it is presented by believers.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>The Kvalisan mythology could be described as theistic animism. There is a multitude of ghosts and gods called Tsuvs which gain strength through worshipers.

<a name="The_Cosmological_Order"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The Cosmological Order </span></h2>
<p>The cosmos is in eternal order. Everything has a place and a time in which to exist. The Kvalis believe that the cosmos itself is a being unaware of the nature of its existence. Whenever anything new is created or born a new Tsuv comes into existence. This spirit is born from the cosmos. All such spirits exist in a hierarchy. However, followers of different Ways interpret a spirit's station within the order differently.
</p><p>Each position within the cosmological order brings a spirit a task or set of tasks which must be fullfilled. There seems to be no way the Tsuvs can decide not to do what the position demands to be done. The reasons for this are discussed within the Ways, each giving its own explanations.
</p><p>The Tsuvs seem to be self aware but under some conditions they may loose their individuality and merge with others to become a greater being.
This can be observed whenever a house is built. Every stone has its own Tsuv. However, after a while the spirits of the individual, component, stones merge together to became one greater Tsuv which possesses the whole house.
On the other hand one Tsuv can become many weaker ones. If you take a branch away  from its tree, a part of the trees Tsuv is taken away and becomes a Tsuv itself.
Merging and splitting are also seen differently in the different Ways.
</p>
<a name="The_Eternal_Struggle"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The Eternal Struggle </span></h2>
<p>Since the Tsuvs became aware of the cosmological order and the fact that they gain strength through worshipers they fought.
The Eternal Struggle describes how every single Tsuv seeks power.
</p><p><i>[draft: the ES as a rule set by the cosmos (there seems no way a Tsuv can break out of it, (s)he can't decide not to fight)]</i>
</p>
<a name="The_great_Tsuvs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The great Tsuvs </span></h2>
<p>Although part of the Eternal Struggle the fight of the Great Tsuvs is different.
Most of them had high positions in the cosmological order since the dawn of time. They had the advantage of a good start. 
Worshiped through all times as gods of the sun, the moons, the stars, the clouds, the wind, the sea and the earth they gained so much strength that there seems no way the lesser Tsuvs could overcome them ever.
Their fights are different and much more complex. Their powers are so great that they can bend the rules of merging and splitting.
It seems as if the cosmos itself tries to limit them by setting new boundaries where they have overstepped others.
</p>
<a name="The_Cycle_and_The_Mystery_of_Lar"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> The Cycle and The Mystery of Lar </span></h3>
<p>The fight between the Great Tsuvs follows a specific choreography set by the Cosmos itself. 
The rules by which they are bound are described as the Mystery of Lar. [TODO: Mystery of Lar as a “contract” by the cosmos which defines the rules of the ES]
The Great Tsuvs change their positions only every four years. After that their fight ends for one short month and than starts over again.
</p>
<a name="Bending_the_Rules"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Bending the Rules </span></h3>
<p>Although the Great Tsuvs are bound by The Mystery of Lar they can bend other rules of the Cosmos.
Where smaller Tsuvs can not control the process of Merging and Splitting the Great Ones can do almost as they wish to.
As a Tsuv possesses the clouds, for example, this power becomes tremendously important.
A normal Tsuv would split whenever one cloud becomes many and merge whenever they merge.
But a Great Tsuv can remain one being in this process.
The situation can become even more complex. If it starts raining every single drop is still possessed by the Great Tsuv of the clouds.
Even when they land initialy they are possessed by that Tsuv. But eventually its influence shrinks and other Tsuvs can possess the fallen rain – in most cases this is the Tsuv of the earth or the Tsuv of the sea and lakes. [Special cases can arise e.g. whenever rain is collected in some sort of containers – the Tsuv of the container is not strong enough to overcome the spirit of the rain and the rain remains a part of th Great Tsuv of the clouds]
</p><p><br />
<i>[draft: fights always last 4 years.</i>
Intrigues are added to their fights (sometimes a tsuv strengheth the position of another and then tries to overwhelm him, so that he gains strength in the coming years) - Names of the Great Tsuvs - Possible positions of the great Tsuvs - Examples for “Their powers are so great that they can bend the rules of merging and splitting.”]
